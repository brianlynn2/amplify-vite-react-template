c6 c36">Author&rsquo;s Note:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c26 c20 c6">This is a work of fiction. &nbsp;While a number of the incidents in this book are inspired by somewhat similar ones that occurred in the author&rsquo;s life, the ones described here are quite different, in that in each case the author has sought to portray his alter ego as far more wise, brave, capable, handsome, and sexy than the author is in real life, and the other people as far more petty, ill-tempered, shallow, stupid, and vain than they really are. &nbsp;He has also forgotten most of the relevant details and made up others just to please himself and show himself in a better light. &nbsp;Many other incidents have been completely fabricated, primarily to boost the author&rsquo;s ego and also to provide some pretense at a narrative arc, where in real life events just bumble along randomly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c29">If you are acquainted with the author and suspect that a character in these pages is based on you, and you are not happy about the characterization, please remember that the author&rsquo;s </span><span class="c29 c6">poor writing skills and shallow, narcissistic soul mean that he is capable of using his words only to create crude, unsympathetic caricatures of people. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c20 c6 c26">&nbsp;The character on these pages is not you, just possibly a half-baked parody awkwardly sketched to entertain, doubtless including details borrowed from entirely different people, with no pretense of verisimilitude. &nbsp;If, on the other hand, you appreciate a characterization that you suspect is based on you, the author wants you to know that this is precisely how he sees you as a person, and he would be pleased to accept gifts and/or sexual favors in recompense for sharing that rendition of you. &nbsp;(Especially sexual favors, though if you actually read the book you would doubtless be able to guess this.)</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c26 c20 c6"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c26 c20 c6"></span></p><h1 class="c3

was dining out on Amber&rsquo;s soft, velvet cleft as she sprawled across Cassandra, who was spatchcocked across the bed and quivering spasmodically, &nbsp;when a thought struck me: &nbsp; this sure as hell beats flying to Cancun for a four night all-inclusive with watered down rum punches and all-you-can-eat buffets of disappointing food. &nbsp; Could it be that mind-blowing sex was the solution to our catastrophic hurtling into disaster, our society&rsquo;s self-destructive urge to </span><span>consume</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;everything and destroy the planet? &nbsp; Could it be that religion had got it wrong, that by suppressing eros we had unleashed Mammon and Adephagia, with unanticipated and damaging consequences? &nbsp;Is sensual hedonism all that bad? &nbsp;And why do I sound like the opening voiceover in a bad episode of Sex in the City?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I turned to Jack, who was watching from the other side of the room with relaxed interest, sprawled naked on an easy chair and languidly touching himself, and called out &ldquo;Toss me another coupla shroom gummies - I think I&rsquo;m coming down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were balls deep into a four day weekend celebrating the new hot tub at the farm, and I was telling stories about how I&rsquo;d got to this point. &nbsp;What had caused me to give up my high flying Wall Street career, blow up my marriage and estrange my kids, undertake a decade of hedonistic adventuring, and become fixated on the future of the planet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A muffled sound came from under Monica&rsquo;s bottom, over in the corner of the room. &nbsp; I stopped pleasuring Amber for a moment and enjoined Monica, &ldquo;Sit up a little, honey, would you? &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to hear what Dan has to say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned forward a little on her knees and Dan&rsquo;s face, moist and florid, appeared from under her hips. . &ldquo;Hey, Bobby, I was just saying, tell us about how you got so fucking obsessed with fucking climate change &hellip; urrgh.&rdquo; &nbsp;Monica plopped back down and the rest of his sentence was cut off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I murmured assent, finished off Amber with two fingers and the tip of my tongue, &nbsp;unchained Cassandra and started in&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Climate Change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or rather, where did my obsession with climate change come from?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Where do I start? &nbsp; With growing up in Montreal during the 1973 oil embargo, terrified of freezing to death during the bitter cold winters? &nbsp; With nerding for hours designing energy self-sufficient, underground, passive solar houses? &nbsp; With programming a Texas Instruments TI-57C calculator to simulate monthly solar energy input? &nbsp; &nbsp;With attending climate conferences in the late &lsquo;70s and learning about how the greenhouse effect would eventually cook us, in maybe 75 or a hundred years? &nbsp;With writing a successful Harvard application essay about alternative energy and global warming? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, no. &nbsp;Truth be told, once I got to Harvard I forgot all about global warming and alternative energy. &nbsp;And as soon as I entered the workforce, any socialistic thoughts I may have had about redistributing wealth were pushed away &hellip; pushed away by dreams of making enough money to escape, first dreams about &nbsp;piles of money, then visions of mountains of money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Initially my fantasy was to buy a waterfront writer&rsquo;s retreat in the Thousand Islands, then it was to buy a float plane and island-hop across the South Pacific, living for days or weeks at a time at each stop. &nbsp; Then later, while working in a corner office overlooking Wall Street, I would dream about starting a financial technology business and making a killing and retiring and buying an island that I would fly to in my private jet to write novels about spies and Wall Street villains threatening to blow up nuclear power plants. &nbsp;(I&rsquo;d read the enjoinder to write about what you know, and I&rsquo;d worked in nuclear shutdown software and on Wall Street trading floors, and I&rsquo;d read a lot of spy novels, so I figured that qualified me.) &nbsp;I imagined smoking a pipe in my office (I still remembered the smell of my Grandfather&rsquo;s briar pipe), gazing over my island, and contentedly pecking away at the computer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, the truth isn&rsquo;t admirable; it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve had a life-long selfless concern for the future of the planet and the well-being of our descendents. &nbsp;Or that I was invariably compassionate and kind and caring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The truth is that I was just as selfish and greedy as everyone else (and probably more than most), and I only became concerned about global climate change and the future of the planet because of pussy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More specifically, because of Cassandra&rsquo;s pussy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;d been on break from each other for a few months, and I&rsquo;d been having a grand old time having threesomes and foursomes and dating three women at a time. &nbsp; But, in truth, I was also a grief-stricken mess, and was missing Cassandra terribly. &nbsp; And Cassandra re-entered my life for a moment - &ldquo;just to talk&rdquo;, she said - and so we did, for about 5 minutes, until we ended up flying &nbsp;into bed, imploding into a writhing blob of intense, gymnastic sex. &nbsp;And all of a sudden I was dating four women at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Cassandra couldn&rsquo;t stop talking about the future of the planet and how our actions were wrecking it and how if things kept going on we would destroy life as we knew it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And somehow this seemed a lot deeper and more important and meaningful than my conversations with my other lovers, the ones I initiated about desires and boundaries and sexual health and food allergies and preferred lube flavors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And somehow her pussy was so enticing, so absolutely thrilling, that it shifted something in me, and I actually started to care a little about someone other than myself, and about the future, for the first time in decades. &nbsp;So I started to reconsider my values, and to think about other things besides who and what I was going to wrap around my cock in over the next few weeks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started talking with my friends about our responsibility towards the environment. &nbsp;This pissed off Brittany, who&rsquo;d made a lifelong career of being an environmental lawyer and policy wonk, and who had burned out and gave up a few years back and decided to travel the world before it all flooded, and to dabble in kinky sex and learn how to give a mean blow job, and to try to learn how to orgasm. &nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she wailed as we lay talking in bed, in the afterglow of love making, my hand absently fondling her blonde pussy, &ldquo;do you care about what that bitch thinks? &nbsp;She never worked towards her convictions, unlike me. &nbsp;And yet you listen to her, not me!&rdquo; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>Brittany for some reason wasn&rsquo;t mollified when I pointed out that she had given up on her convictions and had told me that there was no point, that everything was fucked and we should just make the most of it while we can.</span><span>&nbsp; And that this wasn&rsquo;t a terribly inspiring message, while Cassandra&rsquo;s was a call to action. &nbsp;She </span><span>fretfully </span><span class="c1">pushed my hand away from between her legs and rolled over onto her belly&hellip; but a few good spanks put her in a better mood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Naturally, Cassandra dumped me </span><span>again</span><span>. &nbsp;She was not impressed with my harem of lovers. &nbsp; But somehow, through the roiling, overwhelming grief that followed, </span><span>the </span><span class="c1">awareness of climate and the future stuck with me, even without the pussy that inspired it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amber interrupted, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so full of bullshit. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t give a fuck about anything but your own pleasure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monica demurred, pointing out, &ldquo;Hey, didn&rsquo;t Bobby just give you a freaking amazing orgasm? &nbsp;What gives?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jack called over to Amber, &ldquo;Hey, beautiful! &nbsp;Love you, baby! &nbsp;Let the man talk. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s his party, after all.&rdquo; &nbsp;Amber smiled at her partner and sent air kisses to him: &ldquo;Mwah! Mwah!&rdquo; &nbsp; Jack smiled angelically and rubbed his heart. &nbsp;Cassandra cupped Amber&rsquo;s breast and placed a kiss on her shoulder and murmured how gorgeous she was, and Amber settled back happily, content to have the spotlight of attention shine on her for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jack continued, &ldquo;So, Bobby, I know you were a technology wonk on Wall Street, but how did you end up living this life?&rdquo; &nbsp;He gestured vaguely about the room, naked bodies sprawled randomly across the ottoman and sofa and easy chair, the wood stove glowing warmly, the hot tub outside the window of the farmhouse, the avenue of trees leading from the road, the cow barn in the distance. &nbsp;&ldquo;Was your life always like this, or was there a moment that it all changed?&rdquo;<br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.jiz9bdgw5qrj"><span class="c13">Chapter 2: Or did it begin here?</span></h1><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>It was early 2011, and I was 47, and I&rsquo;d recently moved back to Toronto with my family after making a small killing on Wall Street, and my marriage and my personal life brought me little joy. &nbsp; The move back to the city, after seven or eight years living in the woods in the Poconos, was stimulating, and we were reinvigorating some old friendships, interrupted when we&rsquo;d left for New York City some fifteen or sixteen years before. &nbsp;But </span><span>longed</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for more connection with Mary, a sense of togetherness and companionship, and, truth be told, some more energy in bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>It&rsquo;s not like we had no sex life </span><span>&hellip; Mary dutifully consented to sexual relations every week or so, allowing me to pleasure her until she&rsquo;d had enough, and often vaguely enjoying three minutes of intercourse. &nbsp; But this was nowhere near what I wanted. &nbsp; I wanted her to desire me, and I wanted there to be spark. &nbsp;</span><span class="c18 c9">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;d never had any sexual spark</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- I had fond memories of Amaretto-coated nipples, for instance - and sometimes we could muster it again, say on a weekend together, minus the kids, staying in the spa room in a winery resort in Prince Edward County.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I missed the spark and sizzle of conversations we used to have, when we first dated and early in the marriage, about music and literature and plays and movies. The in-references that came from mixing together different shared genres, like wondering whether Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice would have liked the way that Tafelmusik played that presto movement in the Vivaldi concerto. &nbsp;And I wanted her to look in my eyes and say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s spend an evening in and make love.&rdquo; &nbsp; And not, &ldquo;Can you take Brad to hockey? &nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to help Juliet with a school project.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I cast about for tips and techniques for sexual mastery. &nbsp; I&rsquo;d researched lovemaking skills, but something never seemed to work about them. &nbsp;They felt unnatural, and when I tried them it never seemed to entice Mary very much. &nbsp;They said to be assertive in bed, but somehow it just sounded whiny and Mary would make a face. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then I came across a website called &ldquo;Married Man Sex Life&rdquo;, by a nerdy guy called Athol Kay. &nbsp; His thesis was for there to be great sexual energy between a man and his wife, the man needed to be initiating and creating attraction all the time, not just sitting back and hoping that his wife would get the idea her husband would enjoy a romp in the sack. &nbsp; He tried to bring the techniques of the pick-up artist community to marriage. &nbsp;He wrote about &ldquo;game&rdquo; and seeking &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; and having too much &ldquo;beta&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found his ideas revolting and manipulative and disgusting&hellip; and also kind of fascinating. &nbsp; At first, I couldn&rsquo;t imagine that anything he suggested would actually work on a real, live woman, and certainly not on my matter-of-fact, organized, no-nonsense wife. &nbsp;But his writing was engaging and persuasive, and some of his ideas didn&rsquo;t seem quite as odious as the others, &nbsp;and eventually I decided to test something out. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He encouraged a few testable propositions. &nbsp; For example, he suggested being physical with my wife regularly, even all the time, even when sex wasn&rsquo;t on the menu. &nbsp;For instance, coming up behind her when she was doing dishes and giving her a hug. &nbsp; The idea was to keep physical contact on her mind, and to keep her wanting more, so that when, say, bedtime came, it wouldn&rsquo;t be an imposition to escalate to sex, but rather a gift, to release her from her sexual tension. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought about this, and realized that I hardly ever touched Mary anymore except at bedtime, and that hugging &nbsp;was an uncontroversial, socially acceptable activity, and ought to be good for a marriage, and if it resulted in more sex, it would be even better. &nbsp; So I mastered my discomfort and began initiating the occasional longish hug during morning coffee, or while making dinner. &nbsp;At first Mary was a bit surprised, but she seemed to enjoy it. &nbsp; And after a while I noticed that at bedtime she was a little more receptive to my advances&hellip; Not that she was flinging herself at me, true, but that she was enjoying our evening cuddles (and just cuddles, most of the time) more than usual, and maybe even looking forward to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I took this as a qualified confirmation on Athol&rsquo;s first recommendation, and decided to see if there were any more of his recommendations that I could stomach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had a few more suggestions that I thought I might be able to undertake. &nbsp; First was to get fitter, second was to dress better, and third, and most difficult, was to flirt &hellip; not just with my wife, but with everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I started with fitness. I&rsquo;d restarted playing hockey about 4-5 years back, but one game a week wasn&rsquo;t enough to make me feel really fit. &nbsp;So I got some weights and started doing some dumbbell flys and bicep curls, and within a few weeks</span><span>&nbsp;my body was</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;noticeably firmer and stronger but I had a painful case of tendonitis in my left (dominant) arm. &nbsp;And I had to stop exercising, until I figured out a set of little exercises that would restore my strength. &nbsp; So, after some thought, I joined an exercise and yoga studio. &nbsp; After consulting with a personal trainer, I started high intensity interval training and yin yoga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">HIIT was a revelation. &nbsp; &ldquo;Forty five minutes to change your life,&rdquo; said the instructor, as he led the class (mostly gorgeous or at least fit young women, along with a schlumpy middle-aged man, i.e., me) in a demanding routine of quick drills targeting the arms, abs, legs, and rest of the body. &nbsp; The idea was a series of different exercises, all using most of the body in a variety of ways, would strengthen not just the big muscles (like biceps and delts and quads), but all the little muscles that are needed to actually do things in the real world, the stabilizers. &nbsp;The trainer talked of &ldquo;muscle confusion&rdquo; and &ldquo;functional training&rdquo; and &ldquo;warming the synovial fluid&rdquo; and encouraged us to push ourselves through the successive 30-second spurts of gut-wrenching exercise, each new exercise pummeling the body in a different excruciating way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started with 15 pound kettlebells, oddly shaped lumps of iron that we would heave around uncomfortably, becoming heavier by the minute; I&rsquo;d usually have to drop to lighter weights before long. &nbsp;By the end of each class, after dozens of dive bomber push ups and Turkish get ups and lawn mower pulls and lunge lifts, or some other equally agonizing sequence, &nbsp;I would be a gasping, hurting, twitching puddle of sweat, curled up on the floor of the room, panting and holding my abdomen. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d need to hold on to the railing on the steps as I swayed down to the street, or I would fall down, my legs rubbery, the ground lurching and heaving. &nbsp; The next day I would ache all over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost immediately I saw the results. &nbsp;The fat melted away, my wait shrank and the muscles in my arms became more defined, and I got leaner and stronger, and I could run a block (and more) without gasping for air. &nbsp;I felt great. &nbsp; And all of a sudden, to my immense surprise, I had a huge, absolutely enormous libido, in a way I hadn&rsquo;t felt for years. &nbsp; I was turned on all the time. &nbsp;I constantly wanted to fuck, and I stared hungrily at women on the streets. &nbsp; I looked forward to my HIIT classes, to sweating and hurting while surrounded by sweaty, sexy women. &nbsp;I gradually worked up to 25 and even 30 pound kettlebells.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I noticed that my strength and endurance had improved significantly, even though I didn&rsquo;t look much bigger or bulkier, just a little more trim. &nbsp;I told people I was getting &ldquo;stealth fitness,&rdquo; invisible to the radar but available in an emergency.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;Now and then a muscle bro with a huge chest and shoulders and narrow hips and tiny calves would join the class. &nbsp;He would pick up a 45 lb kettlebell and start heaving it around enthusiastically in sync with the instructor&rsquo;s staccato demands, almost laughing at how easy it was to swing such a puny weight, and sneering at the other class members heaving with difficulty at their ten and fifteen pound weights. &nbsp; Ten minutes later he would be struggling, panting and momentarily hesitating at times, and by the halfway point of the class he would be out of the class, puking his guts out. &nbsp; Seeing this, all the while I was consistently swinging my smaller kettlebells, with no fuss (but with a lot of sweat), gave me immense, evil pleasure - schadenfreude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary noticed that I looked more energized, and seemed to enjoy that a little, and continued to be a little more receptive to my advances. &nbsp; But all of a sudden it seemed like every woman of every age &nbsp;I came across was noticing me in a way I&rsquo;d never seen before. &nbsp; A woman around my age in a class I was taking came up behind me to look at my work &nbsp;and casually took my elbow and whispered in my ear with a smile, &ldquo;You are so inspiring!&rdquo;. &nbsp;This was stunning to me - I couldn&rsquo;t think of a time when a woman that I didn&rsquo;t know had touched me, or had made her interest in me clear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walking down the street one day, a little old Asian lady hobbled by me as I smiled happily. &nbsp;For some reason, after I passed her I turned around to check behind me &hellip; and I saw her turned towards me, also smiling, clearly having enjoyed my energy. &nbsp;I enjoyed that double take.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one day in the summer I was in the park practicing shooting hockey pucks while on rollerblades, shirtless in the heat. &nbsp;And an eleven or &nbsp;twelve year old girl who had been playing tennis nearby came over to chat me up. &nbsp;She explained, &ldquo;I was born in France and my parents are Canadian, and they told me about hockey, but I&rsquo;ve never seen it before. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve just moved to Canada and I want to learn more. &nbsp;How does it work?&rdquo; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>As I practiced and explained to her about pucks and shooting and teams, over the next twenty minutes or so, &nbsp;it became clear to me, even if it wasn&rsquo;t to her (prepubescent as she was), that she was not only interested in hockey, but also in men who played hockey. &nbsp; Particularly shirtless, fit men. &nbsp;It was a lovely sensation to the be the object of lust. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>So Athol Kay&rsquo;s fitness recommendation seemed to be working, even if not totally as intended. But he did say that even if my wife didn&rsquo;t enjoy my attractiveness, eventually someone would. &nbsp;In any event,</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span>feeling sexy </span><span class="c1">and desirable for the first time in my life was heady, and I loved the energy suddenly bubbled forth from my body. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I even noticed that the workouts were helping me think more clearly for my work, which was a surprise. &nbsp;And the yoga classes I was also doing helped me be calmer and more grounded, not to mention slightly less stiff. &nbsp;I noticed feeling happier, and decided to continue the interval training and yoga regime, whether or not it yielded any results in the sack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So given these results, I decided to try a couple of more of Athol&rsquo;s suggestions. &nbsp; The dressing better idea I attempted, with mixed success&hellip; it would turn out that that elegant and sometimes outrageous sartorial display was a skill that I would gradually build over time, with setbacks and wins. &nbsp; (Over the years, I did enjoy being complimented, often by younger women, about looking dapper, usually as I was wearing some preposterous getup mixing jeans and a tuxedo shirt, bow tie, and a tailcoat, or a smoking jacket over a red waistcoat and ascot. &nbsp;Or a fingerless black gloves, a leather vest, and a studded black leather jockstrap - although for this last outfit, &ldquo;dapper&rdquo; was not a word that came up so often.) </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I even had one surprising outcome from the &ldquo;dressing better&rdquo; idea. &nbsp; Some years later, after my marriage had ended, I was hosting a party in my loft and Madison, tall and very thin, with long, straight blonde hair and a killer smile, whom I had a little crush on, arrived with her partner, Mark. &nbsp;I was wearing an absurd outfit with a &nbsp;bright yellow vest and a checked bowtie, and looking like quite the dandy. &nbsp; Probably quite the effete dandy. &nbsp;And all of the ladies there were hanging off me, giggling at my jokes. &nbsp;And Madison was clearly impressed, simpering at me and touching my arm. &nbsp; &nbsp;But less so Mark, who was a truck driver for the movies and a slightly paranoid skeptic. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a while he started to boss Madison around, telling her to put away the dishes, to remind her who she came with. &nbsp;And all of a sudden I realized that he was glaring at me, and that he was trying to intimidate me. &nbsp;(He was half a head taller than me, and wiry and tough, and looked like he knew his way around a knife fight.) &nbsp; I think he was pissed off and afraid that this obviously much wealthier competitor, a girly man, seemed to be charming the panties off his girlfriend. &nbsp;And before I understood what was happening at a conscious level, I knew, I knew without any doubt in my mind, that I would have to fight Mark - that we would be brawling in a moment, and that I had better be ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Instantly I was back in the school yard, and all of those </span><span>brawls </span><span>I&rsquo;d had, the ones where I got beaten up by a kid three years older than me, and would end up in the principal&rsquo;s office, with a fat lip and black eye but the knowledge that I hadn&rsquo;t capitulated to the stronger aggressor, that I had fought my way to respect. &nbsp; I guess it showed in my eyes, that implacable, angry energy, because after a very long moment of direct eye contact, Mark meekly backed down, not relishing a tough fight with a smaller but clearly unhinged foe. </span><span class="c9">&nbsp; </span><span>To my astonishment, </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;after four decades or so of dormancy, my animal fighting instinct was immediate, strong, automatic, and visible to a larger and (apparently) more aggressive male. &nbsp;Mark immediately turned to Madison and demanded that they leave, a demand to which she reluctantly complied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Athol&rsquo;s final idea, flirting - well, let me get back to that in a moment. &nbsp; Because before I got too far in doing that, I got infected by the art bug.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.1ltdy1kas4tl"><span class="c13">Chapter 3: Here. &nbsp;It actually began here.</span></h1><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c25 c20 c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Art. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was trying to reinvigorate my marriage, I was aware of a budding interest in art, and in particular of representational art celebrating the human figure. &nbsp; Not to put too fine a point on it, in paintings of naked people. &nbsp;Mostly paintings of naked women.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My interest in art was old but long suppressed. &nbsp;My mother was an art teacher and as a kid I liked to draw and paint a little. &nbsp;My mom claimed that I had a lot of natural talent, but that by the time I was eight or so I started to get more self-critical and slowed down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In grade 2, we had an assignment to make a notebook with words drawn from the book we were reading, about an African lion, and to make sketches illustrating each word. &nbsp; &nbsp;When I turned in my notebook, the teacher was stunned - for each word there was a page with a little scene drawn in coloured pencil, often in perspective, with the object in context of the African jungle and savannah. &nbsp; She exclaimed about how much skill and talent and effort I&rsquo;d taken to do the work. &nbsp;It hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me that we were supposed to do any less.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Then in grade 3 or 4, along with my class I entered a city wide art contest linked to the Montreal Olympics. &nbsp; My entry showed a javelin thrower, mid throw, against the background of hundreds of spectators looking on from the stadium stands. &nbsp;My mom liked to comment that each spectator I had drawn had their own unique appearance and expression. &nbsp; &nbsp;My entry was chosen to be shown at the school board offices, one of the top </span><span>drawings </span><span class="c1">in the city. &nbsp; My artistic self-regard swelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Then in grade 5 I en</span><span>tered </span><span>Quebec Preparatory School</span><span>,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a school focused on the basics (math and science and grammar) and athletics. &nbsp;It had no art or music program past about grade 6, so my art leanings went dormant, to languish for some years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A decade or so later, at Harvard, while studying Physics, I managed to squeeze into an oversubscribed art class. &nbsp; It was your basic introductory drawing course, with one class, for instance, devoted to drawing a tall stack of stools in perspective. &nbsp; The final class was life drawing - drawing a nude, young, and very attractive female model. &nbsp; This I found rather fascinating, particularly because at that time nude women were not at all a big part of my life, and I highly wished they were. &nbsp; &nbsp;I would love to say I was hooked &hellip; but the hook took a long time to set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also at Harvard I had studied a little art history, particularly in a wonderful class on art &amp; politics taught by Simon Schama, a slightly zany art professor who looked a lot like Elvis Costello. &nbsp;In that class I discovered a strong affinity if not love for the silly, frilly, erotic paintings of the French Baroque and Rococo, by artists like Fragonard and Boucher.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Harvard, I had no more time for art for many years, but as my business started to show signs of bearing fruit and I planned a move back home to Toronto in 2009 or 2010, I thought about doing some more life drawing. &nbsp;Instead I decided to start to collect art reproductions, thinking back to Simon Schama&rsquo;s course and how much I enjoyed Baroque painting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started by collecting half a dozen or more small figurines, replicas of sexy nude sculptures by artists like Canova and Bernini. &nbsp; I owned it as my mid-life crisis moment, telling my family that other men my age bought sports cars, but I had bought these little art pieces. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>But quickly I found myself researching and then buying art prints, by painters who loved rendering the body in glorious detail, like Caravaggio and Boucher and Fragonard, but especially by 19th Century Academic painters like Bouguereau and Alma-Tadema and Poynter and Leighton and Draper and Godward. &nbsp; It became a compulsion. &nbsp;I researched for hours, and ordered prints by the dozen. &nbsp;I collected nearly a hundred prints of varying sizes, many of which were nudes, and framed them for installation in my newly renovated Victorian home. &nbsp;My guideline was to select artworks that had been created no more than a few years after the construction of the house in 1888. &nbsp;Mary and the kids teased me as they tried to corral my impulses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then in July 2011 I went to a Caravaggio show at the National Gallery in Ottawa. &nbsp;I looked at his renderings of flesh with awe and desire. &nbsp; Even male flesh, even greenish, shadowy male flesh - it all attracted me. &nbsp;I wanted to caress the canvas. &nbsp; I almost drooled at the flesh. &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted to be able to create such juicy images. I finally decided to do some figure drawing again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided I would attend &nbsp;a free, open life drawing session on August 1, 2011 at the Ben Navaee Gallery, a small, down-at-the-heels art gallery in Leslieville in east Toronto. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I got ready for the class, I dreamed of what it could be like. &nbsp;I would look at the gorgeous model&rsquo;s body, and miraculously capture her beauty, her flowing hair, her upturned breasts, her soft belly and downy thatch &hellip; I would make a beautiful drawing of a beautiful model, and I would be an artist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sat in my chair in trepidation, belly fluttering, ready to meet this challenge &hellip; and as the model appeared, my stomach almost heaved: &nbsp; The model was not who I had envisioned, not at all: &nbsp;rather, it was a man in his early 70s, paunchy, wrinkled, awkward, tired and aged, with baggy eyes and sagging man boobs and a flaccid, small penis - not fit or beautiful in any way. &nbsp;I would never be able to make a beautiful drawing from this abomination. &nbsp;I had been betrayed! &nbsp; I sat in confusion, gut churning in confusion and dismay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But obedient to the demands of the moment, after a few minutes of indecision, &nbsp;I decided to stay, and I began drawing. &nbsp;And as I drew and worked and sweated, something funny, something completely unexpected, started to happen. &nbsp; I started to notice the lines in the man&rsquo;s face, how worn and craggy he was, with so much character, so much experience. &nbsp;How kind and vulnerable he was to pose for us. &nbsp; How interesting the various folds there were in his body. &nbsp;How much I was suddenly liking him, and how much I was enjoying drawing. &nbsp;How I didn&rsquo;t need to be attracted at first to find so many enjoyable things to draw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In short, I fell in love. &nbsp;I fell in love with that model, and with drawing people, on that evening. &nbsp; I felt so warm, and in awe, and connected, and serene. &nbsp;I noticed that all the voices in my head, the background chatter I rarely noticed but was always there, faded into the distance as I drew, and that I just felt &nbsp;present and peaceful as my pencil scraped quietly across the paper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The love for that model - well, it eventually faded, as it usually eventually does, but I still remember it; the embers in my heart glow a little when I reflect on that day.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know then that I would fall in love, at least a little bit, with almost every model that would draw, and that it had as much to do with looking at them closely </span><span class="c1">as it did with who they were as a person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that night I started drawing all the time - first every week, then twice a week, then four times a week, for three more hours at a time. &nbsp;I started taking classes at art schools, and I even began dreaming of being an artist - a painter who would paint glorious, idealized nudes representing concepts from Physics, like naked twins personifying superconducting Cooper pairs. &nbsp;An artist who I imagined would, over the course of the next decade, develop a career as a prominent and esteemed painter. &nbsp;I fell in love with this new vision of myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>That night, Aug. 1, 2011, more than any other, was when everything started to change. &nbsp;It became a milestone in my life, a date that marked the transition from the old me - technical, dweeby, lonely, </span><span>analytical</span><span class="c1">, miserable - to the new me - artsy, sexy, connected, and so often in the thrall of my emotions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what of the flirting? &nbsp;And where did all that sex come in?</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.dltu2j9o2ult"><span class="c13">Chapter 4: The Arrow</span></h1><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c20 c19 c25"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Flirting. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the thing about flirting is that it&rsquo;s easier to flirt when there&rsquo;s someone to flirt with, someone who responds, at least a little, to the flirting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I would try flirting a little with Mary - to be just a little bit outrageous, to comment off-handedly, with a smile, about how good her body looked - and the comment would hang in the air a moment, glinting strangely, and then fall to the floor with a clatter.. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d look at me with a strange, off-kilter look, a slight, puzzled smile like she wasn&rsquo;t sure who this husband was, making awkward comments about her body, or who or what he&rsquo;d turned into, and shift the conversation to safer subjects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided I needed to get better at flirting, to get more practice. &nbsp;To try out flirting with different people, to see how it felt, to be more relaxed. &nbsp;To try it in places where I wouldn&rsquo;t have to shift an existing pattern. &nbsp;So I would be better and more relaxed and in the future better able to flirt with Mary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I flirted a little with some of my female fellow artists, but it was awkward and I decided not to risk more. &nbsp; I flirted a little with models, maladroitly, garnering a reputation as a creep. &nbsp;I tried flirting with wait staff at restaurants, but I never seemed to figure out what to say until I was on the way home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was doing my day job, running technology standardization meetings for a financial industry association, when one day a new member, Ekaterina, joined. &nbsp;She was an anomaly - she worked for the government, unlike most members, she was a woman, unlike most members,, and she was not afraid to speak out, also unlike most members.. &nbsp; And she was very, very funny. &nbsp; I very much enjoyed her presence at my meetings, noticing how much she enlivened them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One day Ekaterina wrote me an email, looking for a &ldquo;a good man&rdquo; for some position &nbsp;&hellip; she was trying to recruit for some committee. &nbsp;I took this as an opening for some gentle flirtation, suggesting that while I might be a good man, I was not an entirely good man, and I might not be just the man for that position. &nbsp;But perhaps there were other positions I would enjoy with her&hellip; &nbsp;She clearly enjoyed this missive and its flirtatious insinuation, and to my joy and surprise, she didn&rsquo;t huff at my inappropriate note, but rather returned her own flirtatious response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we were off to the races &hellip; the flirtation escalated rapidly, veering into romantic greetings in Italian, (&ldquo;Ciao, bella!&rdquo;), intense sexual innuendo, and so on&hellip; &nbsp;It was a new and heady experience for me, to have such a sexy conversation with a woman, and a woman I hadn&rsquo;t actually met. &nbsp;It felt exciting and dangerous and fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This went on for some weeks, then as we lived far apart and there was little chance to meet, our online flirtation eventually died down, and we stopped our near daily messages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then in late 2011, as my art infatuation started to take off, I got notice that I had a meeting in the city that was, Ekaterina&rsquo;s home base. &nbsp; &nbsp;I reached out again, letting her know that I would be nearby, and would she like to meet?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Thus in mid December 2011, after a boring meeting with some government officials, I found myself waiting downstairs at a drab office building, planning to meet Ekaterina for lunch. &nbsp; She came downstairs in a flurry, a tiny, cute ball of energy, and rapidly in Russian-accented English drew me into a nearby sandwich shop for a quick bite. We talked of nothing - she told me, &ldquo;Russians turn sadness into black humor&rdquo;, we talked of the craziness of government bureaucracy, of mathematics, of my drawing and how I&rsquo;d love to draw her someday (she laughed at that), of my unhappy marriage, and vaguely of her recent divorce - and before I knew it, she was standing to leave and dragging me back to her office entrance. &nbsp;Then off she ran in a flurry to her next meeting. &nbsp;It had been about 45 minutes since she had </span><span>pranced downstairs</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I slowly walked to my next engagement - I&rsquo;d planned to spend part of the afternoon at a small private gallery with some lovely sculptures, and some wonderful large portraits by Sargent. &nbsp; I pondered this conversation, this sprightly, funny, sad, and heartfelt conversation, with a cute and smart woman 10 years or more my junior. &nbsp;This amazing and wonderful and intelligent and joyful conversation, that had made me laugh so much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I walked down the street, I noticed a tightness in my chest. &nbsp;This tightness increased rapidly, into an ache, then into a sharp, shooting pain. &nbsp; I panicked, thinking &ldquo;Heart attack!&rdquo; Or maybe it was an acute case of angina? &nbsp;I wondered whether my Canadian health insurance would cover me if I needed to go to hospital. &nbsp; I sat down on a nearby park bench, looking for my phone, trying to decide whether to call 911. &nbsp;I breathed heavily, and tried to catch my breath and collect my wits, and to see if that intense pain would continue to get worse, frantic with worry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But after a couple of minutes had passed, I noticed something strange: &nbsp;This wasn&rsquo;t an ordinary pain, some kind of angina, or your run of the mill heart attack. &nbsp;There wasn&rsquo;t pain down the left arm, or in the armpit area. &nbsp;It was solidly in the middle of my chest, tightly squeezing the heart. &nbsp; My heart seemed to be beating at close to a normal rhythm. I didn&rsquo;t seem faint. &nbsp;My heart was in a vise, but beating normally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This pain, I slowly concluded, &nbsp;was something else: &nbsp;This was heartache, the intense, sharp heartache of love at first sight. &nbsp;This was Cupid&rsquo;s arrow, lodged firmly and painfully in my ticker. &nbsp;Thinking back, I could almost hear the thrum of the arrow vibrating as it struck me, the arrowhead wedged in my chest. &nbsp;This was love, intense love, something I&rsquo;d never felt in that particular way before. &nbsp;Something I&rsquo;d read about, but never believed really existed. &nbsp; Something that poets conjure up, something that Medieval knights suffered, but that never really happened to mere mortals. &nbsp;But maybe it did, because it seems that it had happened to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I sat on the bench, gobsmacked by this new feeling,</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">unsure what to do next. &nbsp; After a time, as the agony faded back to a strong ache, &nbsp;I drifted in a daze to the gallery, and slowly moved through its halls, eyes barely looking at the beautiful statues and lush paintings, set in a lavish mansion with stone floors and marble stairs. &nbsp;Eventually I sat in front of a large full length portrait of a woman in a white dress by Sargent, and considered my life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could I leave Mary and be with Ekaterina? &nbsp;Would Ekaterina take me? &nbsp;What should I do next?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After several hours of contemplation of the esteemed lady on the canvas and of my fate, I went to the airport to catch my flight home, as there seemed to be nothing else to do. &nbsp; As I waited for my plane, drinking Bloody Marys and worrying, a terrible thought struck me: &nbsp; I had been fixed - I&rsquo;d had a vasectomy. &nbsp;And Ekaterina would want to have children, nay, I would want to have children with her. &nbsp;And there was no guarantee that my vasectomy could be reversed. &nbsp;And maybe she wouldn&rsquo;t want me because of that. &nbsp;And why, oh, why had I got that vasectomy, and why did I think I would never want to have kids again? &nbsp;Grief and regret at the poor decisions I&rsquo;d made in the past suffused my heart; I was suddenly sick with desire to marry Ekaterina and to have children with her &hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I came back to Toronto, in a crazy daze, and all I could think of was Ekaterina. &nbsp; I wrote to her the next day. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming back to see you, Ekaterina. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m head over heels in love! I&rsquo;m going to camp on your doorstep until you take me in. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m leaving my wife and kids and making a new life with you. &nbsp;Where do you live?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She laughed back in her email reply. &nbsp;&ldquo;This &nbsp;is all very cute,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m moving to Belgium tomorrow, and so your trip will be in vain!&rdquo;. &nbsp; Naturally, I didn&rsquo;t believe her, assuming it was an evasion, but it was true: &nbsp;she moved to Belgium that week to work at an international financial agency, and though I tried to convince her to meet with me on my various trips to Europe, she managed to slip through my fingers. &nbsp;And while we remained in touch for years, that was the only time I met her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>So my infatuation with Ekaterina came to nothing, although it took three months or more to die down, and lead to some wonderful masturbatory orgasms&hellip; &nbsp;</span><span>But it did accomplish something: &nbsp;It unlocked my heart, and led to my awareness that I didn&rsquo;t have all of what I wanted in my marriage, that I was missing something that I had never felt was that important: &nbsp;Romantic love. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I noticed that by constantly making an effort, I could get Mary to warm up to me a little, but the moment I stopped, she dropped back to ignoring me, treating me as an inconvenient nuisance. &nbsp; I noticed that it seemed that every woman in the world was more into me than Mary was. &nbsp; And I didn&rsquo;t like it. And I felt that I deserved more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>From then on I started looking at my life for love and connection (and sex and appreciation and adoration and so many other activities and feelings). &nbsp;I noticed that this had never been a priority for me, and grieved that it hadn&rsquo;t been. &nbsp; I decided that the Ekaterina infatuation was more than a surprising brief brain tempest, but rather was a deep welling up from my subconscious of an extraordinarily important need, one that I had suppressed for a very long time: &nbsp;the need to feel connected, and to feel admired and appreciated and cared for by someone close to me in a way that I hadn&rsquo;t felt in years. Instead of being endured as a miserable source of income who was needy and unpleasant, to be at best humored and avoided. &nbsp;In short, to feel romantic love for someone, and to feel loved in return: &nbsp;to feel important and necessary to the people closest to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now this was truly 45 minutes to change my life!</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">*** </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amber was snoring contentedly, sprawled across the ottoman, her legs akimbo, pussy stretched fetchingly. &nbsp;Jack stared into the embers of the fire, sighing, &ldquo;Ahh, love.&rdquo; &nbsp;Cassandra had headed to bed an hour before - she&rsquo;d heard all of this before. &nbsp;And Monica and Dan had headed out to the hot tub for another spin before bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jack said, &ldquo;In the morning, tell me about your childhood. &nbsp;Did you have a lot of friends? &nbsp;Did you do well in school? &nbsp;Did you date girls? &nbsp;How is it that love was never important to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I yawned and promised to do that, and finished sipping my dark rum and Amaretto cocktail, banked the fire, slid into bed with Cassandra, fondling her gorgeous body to sleepy appreciative murmurs, and drifted into a contented sleep.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.9s1y1ahi4lux"><span class="c13">Chapter 5: &nbsp;The Nerd</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Over coffee the next morning Jack guided me back to my early years. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do I understand,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;</span><span class="c9">that when you were young you were more focused on academics and achievement than on people and relationships?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sighed, and stared into my coffee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, I started. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let me tell you,&rdquo; I said to Jack, &ldquo;about how school was for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>I&rsquo;m doing my grade 4 math homework, which I normally blaze through without a pause, and am puzzling over what appears to be a simple question. &nbsp;&ldquo;A clock is set for 1:30 pm. &nbsp; How many times does the minute hand pass the hour hand when the time goes to 2:30 pm? &nbsp;From 1:30 until 3:30 pm? &nbsp;From 1:30 until 7:30 pm?&rdquo; &nbsp; This seems so easy - the minute hand passes by the hour hand once each hour, so the answers should be 1 and 2 and 6. &nbsp; But something doesn&rsquo;t seem quite right about the final question&hellip; Does the minute hand actually pass by the hour hand six times? &nbsp; Studying a clock and then playing with a watch soon convinces me otherwise - the hour hand&rsquo;s slow motion past the half hour mark means that the minute hand never actually catches up to the hour hand during one rotation past the bottom of the clock, and so loses a lap around 6:30. &nbsp;So the correct answer to the last question must be only 5. &nbsp; This surprises me, because it strikes me as a more difficult than usual question for 4th grade, but I&rsquo;m proud that I&rsquo;ve noticed the trick and evaded it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few days later when my graded homework assignment is distributed in class, I see that my answer of 5 has been graded incorrect. &nbsp;A hot streak of shame jolts my body. &nbsp;Had I really got this wrong? &nbsp; I check my work, confirming my analysis, then complain to the teacher that this must be in error. &nbsp; She has none of it. &nbsp;&ldquo;See, here&rsquo;s the answer in the teacher&rsquo;s manual,&rdquo; she says - &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 6. &nbsp;You are wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>An intense jolt of energy hits me, and my teeth grind together. </span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span>I had tested my theory several times. &nbsp;I&#39;m positive that I&rsquo;m right. &nbsp;How could the official answer be wrong? &nbsp; I leap up in frustration and run to the demonstration clock at the back of the room, with hands cut out from construction paper and used to help students learn to tell time. &nbsp; &ldquo;See,&rdquo; I shout, &ldquo;let me show you!!&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp; I twirl the ersatz clock&rsquo;s hands and count the crossings. &ldquo;See, the hands pass only 5 times!&rdquo; &nbsp; Noticing the teacher&rsquo;s slack expression, I repeat the demonstration, sensing that the possibly dim-witted teacher hadn&rsquo;t absorbed the lesson the first time.

&nbsp; Several of the schools talked about how nice looking their campuses were. &nbsp;This was also confusing. &nbsp;Shouldn&rsquo;t they be talking about their education?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The other exciting feature of the college recruitment meeting was that they had an open bar. &nbsp;I felt very grown up when I sidled up to the bar and ordered a gin &amp; tonic from the bartender. &nbsp; </span><span>The first sip convinced me that I&rsquo;d made an enormous mistake - its eye-watering bitterness triggered my gag reflex.. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">I doubted I&rsquo;d be able to finish. &nbsp;But I kept at it, and by the end of the second G&amp;T that evening &nbsp;I&rsquo;d acquired a lifelong taste for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;I did a series of standardized tests - SATs, AP tests, achievement tests, etc. - and my scores were strong enough enough that my guidance counselor convinced me that I should go for it.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I did a series of campus visits, seeing Princeton, Yale, Harvard, MIT, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, near Albany (RPI). &nbsp;My top choice going in was still MIT, but coming out of the tours I had to admit that I liked how beautiful the campuses at Princeton and Harvard were, and how interesting and engaged the students were, especially at Harvard. &nbsp;I even got to stay overnight with a Harvard undergraduate - and I was surprised by their priorities. &nbsp;The most important things on their minds seemed to be entertainment options: what movies would they see that weekend, where should they go to eat dinner, who was dating whom. &nbsp; They did mention in passing that they had classes, it didn&rsquo;t seem to be a focus. &nbsp;This was an academically prestigious school!? &nbsp; It was discomfiting. &nbsp; I noticed how beautiful the Harvard dorms were, and how quaint the ivy-covered buildings looked, and how lively the student body appeared to be. &nbsp;Particularly the female students, a welcome sight after years of boys-only at QPS.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>MIT, on the other hand, boasted an enormously long, dark, echoey corridor that connected most of the buildings, and a lot of pallid, pimply male nerds who spoke in a whine, and blackboards covered with equations. &nbsp;Their student tour guide boasted about how the engineering students would each year disassemble &nbsp;a VW Beetle and reassemble it somewhere inconvenient, like in the dean&rsquo;s office, or up in the cupola of a bell tower. &nbsp;Nerdy good fun perhaps, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure that fun would be enough to carry me through a full four years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>When my acceptances came in, I&rsquo;d been accepted to Harvard, MIT, and RPI, and waitlisted at Princeton (Yale hadn&rsquo;t made the cut). &nbsp;It came down to a choice of Harvard and MIT - RPI was the backup plan, and the small town and 8:1 male to female ratio didn&rsquo;t appeal, despite its beautiful data center built into a remodeled old church, and lit by stained glass windows..</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harvard vs. MIT &nbsp;was a surprisingly difficult choice - MIT was the place that I&rsquo;d dreamed of and admired for years, but Harvard was so much more beautiful, engaging, and varied. &nbsp;It just looked like a lot more fun, truth be told. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t as good for engineering, my planned degree, but I reasoned that I could somehow make it work&hellip;. I could go to MIT for a graduate engineering degree, if I wanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a week or so of soul searching, I opted for Harvard.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c18 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harvard was a revelation. &nbsp; Everything seemed dripping with tradition. &nbsp;The more socially sophisticated students seemed to have figured everything else, where I was somewhat lost at first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a terrific flurry of activity the first few weeks: &nbsp;finding one&rsquo;s dorm room, moving in, going through an elaborate pre-registration process where we picked up material (among it our course catalog and class signup sheet) and ran through a gauntlet of upperclassmen trying to persuade us naive frosh to join their student organizations, like the Harvard Crimson newspaper or the Harvard Lampoon or the Hasty Pudding theatrical club. &nbsp;Then course selection, starting with a &ldquo;shopping period&rdquo; where the students audited a variety of lectures to see which ones seemed most appealing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I quickly came to understand how special it was to be &nbsp;at Harvard: rushing to 9 am Physics class each morning, late, I would have to wend around and through the large hordes of Japanese tourists taking selfies in front of John Harvard&rsquo;s statue. &nbsp; These people actually wanted to be up at that ridiculous time! &nbsp;To see this ridiculous statue! And they were in my way, dammit!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was quickly immersed into a much bigger student body than I was used to. &nbsp;My high school had 70 boys or so each year. &nbsp;Harvard had 1600 incoming freshmen. &nbsp;And they all seemed so smart, talented, accomplished, and good looking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I roomed down the hall from a Juilliard-trained cellist. &nbsp;I took Physics classes with a classmate who had chained himself to the gates of the Seabrook nuclear power plant, organizing a state-wide protest. &nbsp;Living upstairs in my dorm was the daughter of a world-famous photographer. My friends and roommates had studied Greek and Latin at prep school, or knew about exotic musical forms. &nbsp;Even the football jocks, who talked in crude Brooklynese and dragged their knuckles on the ground, successfully executed a complex &ldquo;Multiflex&rdquo; offense, baffling their opponents, and talked of Heidegger and Diderot in line at the cafeteria. &nbsp;And everyone dressed preppy, a look I could recognize and admire but couldn&rsquo;t imagine how to inhabit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the first time in years in school, I didn&rsquo;t stick out. &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t the smartest in my class. No one particularly noticed me. &nbsp;I was part of the crowd. No one bullied me or teased me for being too smart. My peers knew all kinds of things that I didn&rsquo;t, like how to read ancient Greek, or what Martin Heidegger&rsquo;s philosophy meant, or which indie rock bands were emerging from Athens, Georgia. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I loved learning from my few friends, and being challenged. &nbsp; I loved the variety of types of stimulation - the variety of old movies that were screened each weekend (I developed a love for Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant, starting with The Philadelphia Story), the student plays that were produced, the publications, and so on.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Second semester freshman year, early February of 1982, &nbsp;I started auditing a class in the philosophy of government, taught by a screechy German philosopher named Judith Shklar. &nbsp; It was a two-hour lecture directly after a carb-rich lunch, and I would need to fight to stay awake. &nbsp;My eyelids would flutter shut as Dr. Shklar droned about classical and medieval philosophy, tossing in Greek ideas like agape and kudos. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as I struggled to take in this monotone, I realized that there were nuggets of gold in her words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>F</span><span class="c1">irst we read Plato, and learned all about his amazing, wonderful, thoughtful ways of understanding government and politics. &nbsp;It all seemed so wise and true, and Prof. Shklar&rsquo;s insights were thought-provoking.. &nbsp;Then we read Aristotle, and his insightful categorization and listings of the various ways that city states would govern themselves. &nbsp;And his words also seemed so wise and thoughtful and true. &nbsp; And then I noticed, to my surprise and chagrin, that Plato and Aristotle had totally different ways to see the world, completely different ways to understand things. &nbsp;And that they often contradicted each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could this be? &nbsp;How could these two revered, brilliant philosophers, so thoughtful, so wise, so right, how could they disagree? &nbsp;And which of them was right? &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t seem obvious, though I had a leaning for Plato&rsquo;s idealism.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was my introduction to critical thinking - to noticing that just because someone is smart and makes a good argument, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are right. &nbsp;That we need to figure out our own values for ourselves, and test the strength of other thinkers&rsquo; arguments. &nbsp;Shklar&rsquo;s lectures pointed out some of the similarities and contrasts between the different philosophers - men like Thomas Aquinas and John of Salisbury and Thomas Hobbes - and helped us see that no one has a monopoly on truth, that getting closer to it requires thought and discernment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a week or so of this, I decided that this kind of mind-opening, inspiring learning was what I really wanted to focus on in university. &nbsp;About how to think critically about all kinds of things, not just philosophy, but history, literature, and anything else that caught my fancy. &nbsp;So I signed up for a couple of inspirational classes along with my challenging but narrower math and physics and engineering classes. &nbsp;Along with Shklar&rsquo;s political philosophy I took a fun developmental psychology class that included a strong dollop of ethnology.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the semester got going, I realized that the workload of this was going to be heavy. &nbsp;And that as an engineering student, this would be nearly my last chance to study much of the humanities. &nbsp;And that in the following years I would be doing many, many engineering classes, and relatively few non-science classes. &nbsp;And that, to be frank, I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying my engineering very much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I went for a long walk, studying the Charles River at the South end of campus. &nbsp;As I crossed and recrossed it, leaning over the parapets of the bridges, watching the cold Charles eddying by, &nbsp;I asked myself: &nbsp;how much does this vision of being an engineer still draw me? &nbsp;How much do I want to learn about new things, about different things, about the humanities, and social sciences? &nbsp; Could I give up Engineering?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>By the end of my walk I had convinced myself to drop my Engineering class and change my concentration to Physics, which (as a bachelor of arts instead of a bachelor of sciences) had a much lower number of required science classes, and therefore would allow me to take many more humanities and social sciences classes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This felt like a bit of a cheat and a cop-out, but was also supremely exciting. &nbsp; I could take whatever classes that I wanted!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the next three years I turned course selection into an art form, taking classes in history and historiography, classics, cognitive psychology, literature, biology, music, cinema, art, and art history, along with more technical classes like economics and computer science.. &nbsp;I chose my courses largely based on how imaginative and engaging the professor was. &nbsp;(I dropped &ldquo;Comedy and the Novel&rdquo; because I found the first lecture stultifying, for instance. &nbsp;The surgery was successful but the patient died.) &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I found exhilarating inspiration in all the different ways to think that I was exposed to, the myriad mental and analytical frameworks. &nbsp;I started noticing patterns across courses, finding similarities in themes in different domains, and using that to develop a personal theory of learning and understanding.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; I had learned how to learn, in a way that suited me well, and let me rapidly assimilate new areas &ndash; a skill that proved useful the rest of my life.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Late Junior (third) year I started developing an interest in chaos theory, a then-new and somewhat arcane branch of physics and math. &nbsp; I decided that I would like to do an undergraduate thesis in nonlinear dynamics. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I needed to find an advisor. &nbsp;This proved more difficult than expected. &nbsp;I spoke with a number of professors in the Math and Physics department. I was intrigued by Shlomo Sternberg&rsquo;s trademark black beret, much more stylish than the yarmulkes that some other professors wore. &nbsp;But none of these brilliant, revered figures had time for a lowly Physics undergrad who was interested in this oddball branch of math. &nbsp;Eventually someone pointed me towards the Applied Physics department, where a lowly condensed matter physicist was playing around with chaos in semiconductors. &nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t much, but it was all I could get, so I took it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As my first task, Professor Oostenheim assigned me to present a review article covering various types of chaos to a physics colloquium. The review article was long, perhaps 50 pages of closely typeset text with formulas and diagrams, summarizing the result of a large number of scientific papers, covering different types of chaos. It was essentially a long encyclopedia article aimed at scientists and laying out the current state of chaos theory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Starting with the first discovered Lorenz attractor (the &ldquo;butterfly effect&rdquo;), it delved into different types and aspects of chaos, many of them new to me, such as period bifurcation into chaos as described by Mitch Feigenbaum, iterated 1-D chaotic maps, Pomeau-Manneville intermittency, Van der Pol oscillations, and so on. &nbsp; It was a pretty tall order for me to get familiar with all this new and complex material &nbsp;in a week or two, and to be ready to present this to several dozen professors, post-docs, and graduate students in a Friday afternoon session.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>W</span><span>ith considerable effort, I managed to get a good intuitive sense of each of the types of chaos. &nbsp; At the colloquium I was gamely presenting the material with metaphorical explanations and diagrams, when the questions started to come from Prof. Oostenheim. &nbsp;They were detailed, incisive, challenging: &nbsp;Which previous study was this work based on? What did this parameter mean, &nbsp;exactly? &nbsp;Could I write down the formula describing that type of chaos?</span><span>&nbsp; I noticed my throat closing, my midriff clenching, and my face flushing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rarely had I been so unprepared for the piercing, precise questions of a teacher, rarely had I been so caught out of my depth. &nbsp;My lack of knowledge and the shallowness of my familiarity with the topic was humiliatingly on display in front of a room full of Harvard physicists. &nbsp; I found myself mumbling, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember&rdquo; into the silence, again and again; no one rescued me. &nbsp;I sweated and mumbled and apologized and proceeded haltingly. &nbsp;It felt so unfair and so unnecessary; there was a tightness in my gut, and my eyes were burning with shame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I managed to hold back the tears brimming my eyes, but it was a near run thing. &nbsp; I felt blindsided and angry, like I had been asked to perform an impossible task, set up to fail. &nbsp;Afterwards, I miserably stood around at the post-presentation wine and cheese, trying to avoid catching anyone&rsquo;s eye. &nbsp;A sympathetic grad student eventually hove to, commented &ldquo;Wow, that was a tough one!&rdquo; with a wry smile, then sauntered off. &nbsp;The post docs chatted and laughed together, occasionally glancing over towards me, shaking their heads.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I concluded &nbsp;that Oostenheim had decided to haze me, to try to scare me off.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; But I refused to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>After that ignominious display, Prof. Oostenheim assigned me to work with a postdoc, washing his hands of me. Although he did allow me to use resources in his lab. &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t speak to him again until nearly the end of the year, many months later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the meanwhile, I started studying a nonlinear dynamical system that Oostenheim and the student had identified, a system that sometimes exhibited chaotic behavior. &nbsp;The dynamical system was represented by a system of three nonlinear equations. &nbsp;Could I figure out when it would exhibit chaos? &nbsp;What values of the parameters of the equation would bring on the non-linear effects?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I built a computer program to simulate the dynamical system, and started working late nights running simulations and trying to understand how it worked. &nbsp;As I ran the program and it generated results, I found myself intensely curious, trying to understand how it worked and to predict how adjusting the various parameters would affect its behavior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; I got technical, and pulled out my math: &nbsp;I derived the Jacobian matrix, an array of partial derivatives of the system with respect to its state variables. &nbsp; The Jacobean matrix was used in analytic solutions for linear systems, but for the less tractable non-linear system it wasn&rsquo;t believed to be nearly so useful. &nbsp;I programmed and calculated and graphed properties of the Jacobian called &ldquo;eigenvalues&rdquo; and &ldquo;eigenvectors&rdquo; in different places, and used that to try to predict how different chaotic behaviors might arrive. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harking back to idea in the review article I had butchered at that horrible colloquium in the early fall, &nbsp;I found a way to derive an iterated one-dimensional map from the model, and showed how the different types of chaos found in the 1-D map also could be found in the real system. &nbsp;Each time I did something that seemed to work, I found myself getting more excited, and working harder and later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would work until late at the lab, close to midnight, and then walk home, tired but excited, listening to bootleg music tapes on my Walkman as I pondered my evening&rsquo;s observations. &nbsp;The beat of the music would power my tired legs past the northern edges of Law School and by Lesley College as I headed up to my room in the Quad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;In short, I began to think I was learning something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Around April I presented my results to Oostenheim in a meeting in his office. &nbsp;As I started describing my work on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, he was visibly unimpressed. &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of all this?&rdquo; he fumed. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is a waste of time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I paused, abashed, wondering if I had wasted a whole year of work. &nbsp; Eventually I screwed up my courage and mumbled, &ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ll see as we get further in. &nbsp;I found this useful to help me understand what was going on.&rdquo; &nbsp; But I wondered if I knew what I was doing, after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Oostenheim was not at all convinced, but agreed to continue to hear me out, making faces and muttering objections. &nbsp; But by the time we had got to the end of my thesis, his tone had changed, first to curiosity, then to wonder &hellip; this was something he hadn&rsquo;t seen before. &nbsp;I showed that areas where the eigenvalues were positive corresponded to places where the orbits stretched apart from each other, and areas where they were negative aligned with places where the orbits twisted closer together: the familiar stretching and folding observed with some kinds of chaos. &nbsp; The Jacobian eigenvalue study was useful, and the 1-D map projection was fascinating. &nbsp; My ideas, so different and strange, actually had some merit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The tension and distance between us evaporated. &nbsp;He smiled and shook my hand and congratulated me for my work. &nbsp;He told me that he thought we could publish a paper in </span><span class="c6">Physica D</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6">Physica Scripta </span><span class="c1">based on my work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Oostenheim recommended me for a Thomas Hoopes prize, a coveted prize for an outstanding Senior thesis, commenting that my work compared favorably to that of advanced doctoral students. &nbsp; When the awards were announced, I had won the Hoopes. &nbsp; Vindicated at last! &nbsp;And my self-respect, so tattered after that horrible colloquium in October</span><span class="c1">, was restored.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>During graduation week I found myself suddenly shouldering a huge, unexpected grief. &nbsp; My Harvard experience had been full of periods of sadness and loneliness, and if you&rsquo;d asked me along the way &nbsp;I would have said that &nbsp;</span><span>I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;myself that much. &nbsp;But I was living life to the fullest, pushing myself very hard in many directions. &nbsp;As it came to an end I &nbsp;knew that things would change, and that I wouldn&rsquo;t experience that type of cocoon again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I spent the final weeks grieving, with a lump in my throat, and a persistent case of heartburn. &nbsp; I drank too much at dinners, slept badly, and tried to hide my tears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After I graduated, though, Harvard became kind of a footnote, in many cases. &nbsp; When people asked me where I went to college, if I said &ldquo;Harvard&rdquo; they would go, &ldquo;Oooooh, Harvard!

&nbsp;I know it does for me!&rdquo; &nbsp;She wiggled her pelvis and pouted her lips and struck a seductive pose</span><span class="c1">, with her hands out beckoning towards me, framing her torso. &nbsp;Her towel slid to the ground, and my eyes followed it down, then back up her body, pausing only a moment or two at various landmarks on the way up before meeting her coy smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My manhood stirred, &nbsp;apparently satisfied by the sight of my friend&rsquo;s fine figure, &nbsp;and remembering with pleasure the little bit of Monica in my life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sighed. &nbsp; &ldquo;Well, let me explain &hellip; for me being smart wasn&rsquo;t a recipe for being liked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.re9uqkqs79gm"><span class="c13">Chapter 6: &nbsp;The Lonely Boy</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>I&rsquo;m five </span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><span>years old and my mom has brought me to the local elementary school. &nbsp;She wants to say hi to a teacher there - I think they had bonded over art, as both of them are art teachers specializing in primary school. &nbsp; She comes into the classroom - a room full of kids a few years older than I - with me in tow. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m flustered, unsure what to do - I hide in her skirt, grabbing onto her legs. </span><span>M</span><span class="c1">y legs quiver, my stomach churns, and I feel my face flush red. &nbsp; &nbsp;The big kids laugh at me and point. &nbsp; I hear them talking to each other about me. &nbsp; I want to disappear, to be anywhere else but there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shy&rdquo;, she tells me afterwards. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re shy.&rdquo; &nbsp;And she tells her friends the story, about how shy I am. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure if she&rsquo;s proud or concerned, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem an entirely good thing. &nbsp; Maybe an oddity to be endured with dignity, until I grow out of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I don&rsquo;t seem to grow out of it. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t mix particularly well with the other kids. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m often anxious in new social situations, or with large groups of strangers. &nbsp;My reputation for shyness grows. &nbsp; I find mixing with strangers painful, and I avoid it. &nbsp;I have a few friends, but find it hard to reach out further.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gradually intuit that I&rsquo;m not exactly like other kids, particularly boys. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m too loud, I cry too easily, I get distracted. &nbsp; One day I&rsquo;m at the hospital, getting ready for a tonsillectomy. &nbsp; &nbsp;The surgery doesn&rsquo;t particularly frighten me, but they want to give me a shot beforehand (presumably a sedative), and I&rsquo;m having none of it. &nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been having allergy shots for years, and I&rsquo;ve learned that not only are they painful, but afterwards my arm swells up and is sore for a day. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m terrified of them, and my parents have to chase me down to get me to take them each time, every few weeks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The nurse, a starchy middle-aged woman, &nbsp;says, &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t hurt a bit,&rdquo; and I know she&rsquo;s lying. &nbsp; I glare at her, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &nbsp;I struggle, attempting &nbsp;to evade the shot. &nbsp; She tries to compel me to sit, grabbing me and holding me down. &nbsp;She tells me that I&rsquo;m not a good boy, that all the other boys are brave and I&rsquo;m not, that I need to learn to be brave. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s in vain, and I struggle more, yelling &ldquo;NO! Stop!&rdquo; as loud as I can, my shouts echoing through the hospital corridors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, frustrated and exasperated by my defiant behavior, the nurse pulls another card out of her deck. &nbsp; She goes away for a moment, leaving me strapped into my seat, and gets a girl about my age to come over to see what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;&ldquo;Laugh at him!&rdquo; the nurse says, &ldquo;Go ahead, laugh at him.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girl titters, uncomfortably, but with an edge of malice and triumph at my weakness. &nbsp;I slump in my chair, humiliated. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not being a brave boy, I&rsquo;m a fraidy cat, and even a little girl can see that. &nbsp; I blush red, and try not to cry. &nbsp; The shot goes in, burning painfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only am I shy, but I&rsquo;m also a coward, and everyone knows that - the girls know that. &nbsp;I feel more isolated from the other kids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>When I start going to QPS, things get a little more </span><span>complicated. &nbsp; I travel a long way the other direction from most of my classmates, coming into the big city from a not very affluent suburb. &nbsp;They inhabit a different social stratum than I do - most of them are scions of wealthy doctors and lawyers and stockbrokers, and in a few cases their dads are captains of industry; their names adorn buildings and businesses around the city. &nbsp;My parents are a hard working engineer who travels to exotic locations like Prince Rupert and Atikokan to tend to pulp and paper mills, and a stay at home mom who sometimes works as a supply teacher.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; It does not seem particularly prestigious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Going home with my classmates after school doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an option&hellip; my home is so far away from theirs, and our interests seem so different. &nbsp;They loiter at the top of the street and smoke, which is strictly prohibited by the school, and I don&rsquo;t want to do that. &nbsp;They talk of hanging with girls from other exclusive private schools, schools for girls. I don&rsquo;t know any private school girls, nor of any who come from my area. As we grow older they talk of fooling around with some of those girls. &nbsp;The life they describe seems mysterious to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;I enjoy working on my own projects - on my many designs (rarely executed, for lack of money), for instance, of model airplanes and hovercraft, and solar-heated homes, and electric cars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Eventually, my mother notices my solitary behavior. &nbsp;&ldquo;Who are your friends?&rdquo; she asks.. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ever play with them? Why don&rsquo;t they come over?&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know what to say. &nbsp; </span><span>That some of them take a school bus the other way to swanky Town of Mount Royal, and hang out with each other? &nbsp;That others are picked up by drivers, or by mothers that look very different from her, dressed in fancy clothing, driving BMWs and Jaguars? &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">That they wouldn&rsquo;t accept an invitation out to Dorval, and that I hadn&rsquo;t been invited to TMR or Outremont. &nbsp;I just tell her the truth, which was that I&rsquo;m not interested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She continues with the theme: &ldquo;Look, you need to have friends,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important. &nbsp;I want you to work on it.&rdquo; &nbsp; I grimly, reluctantly promise to do something about it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>I make an effort to hang out at lunch and after school with some of my TMR schoolmates. &nbsp;As they talk about getting together after school, I ask about how they get there, about how they get home. &nbsp;I comment that it sounds fun. &nbsp;One of them laughs, &ldquo;Yeah, we have a blast. &nbsp;Sometimes I stay for dinner, and then my mom drives me home.&rdquo; He then turns to the other boys and says, &ldquo;Hey, I have a new video game, </span><span class="c6">Flight Simulator</span><span class="c1">! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s amazing. &nbsp;You can crash your plane into buildings and everything! &nbsp;Do you want to come to my place and play it?&rdquo; &nbsp;He&rsquo;s turned his back to me; I&rsquo;m clearly not included in the invitation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t figure out how to fit in with this world, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to want me to. &nbsp;Nothing happens to bring me closer to the other boys, and I drop it, relieved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Eventually, seeing no progress, Mom escalates, and asks me to talk to the pastor, the Reverend Smythe, &nbsp;about why I have no friends. </span><span>&nbsp;One day, after visiting my mother at home, he calls me to our living room for a (semi) private talk. &nbsp;Mom busies herself in the kitchen, listening in with one ear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After some pleasantries, he says, &ldquo;Your mother tells me you have no friends at school. &nbsp;Do you want to talk about it?&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t, I really don&rsquo;t, but feel that I have no choice. &nbsp;This is Rev. Smythe, who is a Good Man and a Man of God, and who wants the best for me. &nbsp; I must answer him. I do my best, but somehow I can&rsquo;t really explain what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp; I feel my face flushing red in embarrassment and humiliation. &nbsp; I am ashamed that I am disappointing my mother this way, and Rev. Smythe. &nbsp;He is a kindly man and only wants what&rsquo;s best for me, and I&rsquo;m not capable of doing it. &nbsp; I am tongue tied, confused, and sad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rev. Smythe talks some more about how important friendships are, and how we have a responsibility, even a God-given duty, to connect with others, to support and care for them. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s not just for us alone: if we don&rsquo;t have friendships, we are failing other people and our God. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is heavy stuff. &nbsp;I hadn&rsquo;t realized what a huge sin I was committing by keeping to myself, and what a failure and disappointment I was, not only to my mother, but to the Rev. Smythe and to God. &nbsp; I notice that I am being selfish, a Bad Person. &nbsp;And also that I am a scaredy Shy Person who can&rsquo;t get over my shyness. &nbsp;I am Different From Other Boys. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m not good at this thing called friendship. &nbsp;With a huge lump in my throat, I promise to try harder, to try to get to know more kids my age, to make friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I start to feel really bad about how I&rsquo;m not connecting with kids the way I should, and to feel a lot of pressure. &nbsp;I start to feel even more uncomfortable around my classmates, noticing that I&rsquo;m not friends with them, and wondering what to do about that. &nbsp; I notice that when I ask to be included in activities, I am extremely awkward and nervous. &nbsp;I notice how uncomfortable I feel. &nbsp; I notice how the other boys laugh at me, and tell me that they don&rsquo;t want me around, that I&rsquo;m no fun. &nbsp; I notice that I&rsquo;m failing at friendship.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, I stopped telling the story for a minute, because Jack was tied up back to back with Cassandra in front of our little group, and he needed some attention. &nbsp;I pulled his sexy bikini bottom down, exposing his large but flaccid cock, and gave it a number of good, long, luxurious sucks, until it was standing at attention. &nbsp; He gurgled happily. &nbsp; Then he hinted that some more sensation would be enjoyable, so I attached a series of clothes pins to the skin around his nipples and to his scrotum. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oooh, wheee&hellip;&rdquo; he moaned, closing his eyes. &nbsp; Satisfied with this interaction, I stood back a little to admire my work. &nbsp;The clothes pins moved a little as Jack breathed, and his cock waved about, saluting the audience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amber took over from me, grabbing the long leather flogger and caressing Cassandra and Jack with it, sliding it up Cassandra&rsquo;s inner thighs. &nbsp;Cassandra squealed. &nbsp; I resumed my story.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I got to Harvard, it was a little easier at first. &nbsp;Freshman year everyone was thrown into a new heap, and everyone felt a little lost, and everyone clung at first to their roommates, unless they really couldn&rsquo;t stand each other. &nbsp; A few people knew some other students, often from attending prep school together, places like Andover and Exeter and Groton, and those students acted as social glue to bring together larger groups of people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Freshman year I went to some of the big parties they</span><span>&nbsp;threw in honor of the big football games (the Dartmouth game in particular) to try to meet people. &nbsp; The parties were crowded, loud, sweaty, and beer-soaked. &nbsp; At one, while gingerly guiding my cup of beer up</span><span>&nbsp;a crowded stairway, my feet sticking to the spilled beer on the floor</span><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup><span>, with the damp, bitter fug of warm suds and sweat in the air, and the din of boisterous conversations making it impossible to communicate, I was jostled by a huge football player. &nbsp; Beer poured all over me. &nbsp; I </span><span>surveyed my sodden shirt and trousers, a frown dragging down the corners of my mouth</span><span>.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;The gridiron giant turned and noticed the moistened freshman drooping behind him. &nbsp; He smiled an enormous smile at me: &nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re alright,&rdquo; he drawled drunkenly. &nbsp;&ldquo;You can put up with it when shitty things happen to you. &nbsp; I like you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I considered what might have happened if I had taken umbrage at this massive, drunken athlete. &nbsp;</span><span>Did I really have any </span><span>choice</span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup><span>? Should I have started a fight and gotten smeared into the ground? &nbsp; Was I just a chump who didn&rsquo;t stand up for himself? &nbsp;How did I feel about a guy who admired me for my lack of </span><span>self-esteem</span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><span>? &nbsp; I headed home to my quiet dorm room to ponder my priorities and self-respect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we moved through the years, it occurred to me that other students were connecting better than I was. &nbsp; I noticed that as hard as I tried to make friends, it didn&rsquo;t seem to happen very often &hellip; I continued some of my friendships with my roommates and a couple of physics classmates, but not much else happened. &nbsp; And somehow girls never seemed to be part of my social orbit, and it was beyond me how to change that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Going to parties on my own (I always went on my own, because my few friends were never interested) was invariably excruciating. &nbsp; I would go and wonder what to do, who to talk to. &nbsp; I would stand along the walls feeling a tightness in my throat and a pricking in my eyes, as I looked at all the students mixing and drinking and dancing. &nbsp; I would tell myself to talk to someone, and look around, and wonder who to accost, noticing that everyone seemed to have someone to talk to, except for the few other awkward boys like myself, most of whom I knew well enough to know I didn&rsquo;t want to know them better. &nbsp; I would have a beer or two and head home, a lump in my throat, before the tears began streaming down my face. &nbsp; Then I would berate myself for being so shy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I occasionally had a few, slightly better experiences at parties. &nbsp; At one Halloween party I got a stack of flyers from a local business, of the type the Square kids hand out in Harvard Square. &nbsp; I intrusively handed them out to party guests, thrusting flyers in their face in a disagreeable fashion, just like the square kids did. &nbsp;I smirked broadly, pleased with the mischievousness of &nbsp;my costume, and with the annoyed reactions of my hapless flyer recipients to being interrupted in their conversations. &nbsp;I headed home before I got beaten up, enormously chuffed with my creative approach to Halloween.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>At another party, the beginning of a new year, &nbsp;I had an even better time. &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;I had a drink or two, or maybe even more, and danced with abandon &hellip; I gyrated to the Time Warp, and to Psycho Killer by the Talking Heads, and moved without caring what I looked like, unselfconsciously pulsing with the music and the energy of the room. </span><span>&nbsp; I also saw a cute girl there, someone I decided I wanted to g</span><span>et to know better</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span>&hellip; I lost track of her that night, but a few days later I saw her on campus. &nbsp; </span><span>I headed towards her when I saw her walking across Harvard Yard from me. &nbsp; &nbsp;She turned somewhere before I got really close, and I wasn&rsquo;t near enough to say hi.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A few days later, &nbsp; I was walking well behind her, and noticed her, and sped up a little to try to catch her before she got to her destination, without being too obvious that I was chasing her. &nbsp; At some point she glanced over her shoulder in the distance&hellip; then after a few steps she turned a corner, heading off at right angles, and loped determinedly into a classroom building. &nbsp;I faltered, and slowly headed on my way. &nbsp; After a few more experiences like this, I realized that this wasn&rsquo;t a coincidence. &nbsp;She was noticing me and actively avoiding me! &nbsp;I was confused, because we&rsquo;d never actually met. &nbsp;How could she already know that I wasn&rsquo;t friend material? &nbsp; Usually that took a face to face conversation. &nbsp;I racked my brain thinking of any reason she could dislike me, anything I might have done to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>After some time, some images floated into my mind:</span><span>&nbsp; It was yours truly, Bobby Lindo, &nbsp;chugging beers and attempting a sloppy head stand against a wall at the party. &nbsp;Then, praying over the porcelain altar, retching</span><span>, my mouth full of bil</span><span>e, puke in the toilet bowl and the rim, and on the floor nearby.. &nbsp;Apparently I&rsquo;d forgotten the tiny detail that at that party &nbsp;I&rsquo;d thrown up from alcohol intoxication, and someone had guided me to the toilet to try to minimize the mess. &nbsp; That person&rsquo;s face slowly floated into my mind&rsquo;s eye, blurry but </span><span>recognizable</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;Cute avoidant girl. &nbsp; Fuck! Fuck!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At some point, around senior year, I gave up. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was walking through a student parking lot on the way home from my physics lab, when I distantly saw a dude I knew vaguely walking with a cute girl in tow and then popping with her into a BMW and peeling out of the parking lot. &nbsp; I noticed the difference between us: &nbsp;him with his preppy outfit and fancy car and his girlfriend, and me, poorly dressed, hungry, tired, on foot, and alone. &nbsp; I realized that we weren&rsquo;t the same. &nbsp;Some people were cut out for &nbsp;- well, people - while others were cut out for working late in labs and doing research. And I was cut out for ratiocination, not for relating..</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I decided that this &ldquo;making friends&rdquo; bullshit was for the birds. &nbsp; That I would just live my nerdy life - that I wasn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c9">suited for </span><span class="c1">friendships, and I needn&rsquo;t bother trying to prove otherwise. &nbsp;I stopped going to parties, which were always so uncomfortable. &nbsp; I felt more relaxed and better about life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Almost immediately I noticed a change. &nbsp; One day I was at the dining hall eating alone, happy in my solitude. &nbsp; &nbsp;I happened to notice a slight acquaintance emerging from the cafeteria line. &nbsp;In the past I would have waved at him, hoping that he would come my way &hellip; usually people wouldn&rsquo;t see me, and would head elsewhere, and I would feel glum. &nbsp;But this time I quickly put my head down and looked away so he wouldn&rsquo;t see me. &nbsp; There would be no chance of being interrupted in my cheerful contemplation of my own </span><span class="c9">psyche</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Unexpectedly, the acquaintance made a beeline for my table and sat down with me, asking me how it was going. &nbsp;I paused, slack-jawed. </span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span>Couldn&rsquo;t he see I was happily eating alone? &nbsp; I decided to be chill about it, and tolerate his audacity, for he did not know that I had no need of him. &nbsp;The dinner was fine, other people sat down, conversation ensued</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;Somehow the solitary meal didn&rsquo;t work out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>To my further surprise, this pattern repeated itself. &nbsp; I noticed that without trying to connect, in fact while actively trying to avoid people, I was having more acquaintances than ever before, people were actually seeking me out, and that some of those acquaintances were even turning into mild friendships. &nbsp; &nbsp;There was th</span><span>e guy I always called</span><sup><a href="#cmnt9" id="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Howard&rdquo;, who was not, in fact, actually called Howard - this memory lapse turned into a running gag, with everyone at dinner calling everyone else &ldquo;Howard.&rdquo; &nbsp;There was the </span><span>guy </span><sup><a href="#cmnt10" id="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup><span class="c1">who was majoring in psychopharmacology, and who would regale us with stories of the various hallucinogens he was testing. &nbsp;There was the lovely young woman with the pronounced underbite whom I found cute but was too shy to (or as I told myself, chose not to) get to know better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I couldn&rsquo;t get it - I had decided I didn&rsquo;t need </span><span>friendships</span><span>, and everybody somehow, strangely, got the opposite message. &nbsp;They seemed to think I welcomed their company. &nbsp; It was confusing and amusing. &nbsp;I decided to tolerate them; apparently my decision to eschew </span><span>companionship </span><span class="c1">was a good way to have people to chat with. &nbsp;Keeping it distant seemed to be a good strategy. &nbsp; Push them away, and they would come back for more. &nbsp;Or something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I kept at this strategy for the next few decades &nbsp;&hellip; I pushed people away. &nbsp;I made no attempt to connect. &nbsp; I reveled in the fact that I wasn&rsquo;t cut out for friendship. &nbsp;I assumed that this was how it would work for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>But unlike at college, people didn&rsquo;t just gravitate towards me.</span><span>Other than my family I had nearly no one.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I paused my story for a moment. &nbsp; Jack was now lying face down on top of and tied to Cassandra, the both of them on the ottoman. &nbsp;Jack&rsquo;ss ass was jutting fetchingly in the air, and Monica was pondering what to do. &nbsp;My groin stirred a little, but I was in the middle of a story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Would you like some lube, hon?&rdquo; &nbsp;I inquired. &nbsp;&ldquo;A glove?&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tossed Monica a nitrile glove and some aqualube, watched for a moment as she donned it and got to work on Jack&rsquo;s prostate, and resumed my story, satisfied that my hosting duties were being taken care of.</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t until I started doing art in 2011 that things started to change. &nbsp; I volunteered to coordinate models for the local free life drawing group, because the previous incumbent stepped down. </span><span class="c1">And in doing this I started connecting with models and artists, and started, despite myself, making acquaintances and then friends. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>After a few months, one of the artists invited me to join another weekly life drawing group that met at members&rsquo; homes. &nbsp;</span><span>It became my primary artistic and social group, and I started to form friendships. &nbsp;These nascent friendships were fascinating to me - some of the artists were much younger than I, and all of them had a creative and artistic sensibility that was novel to me.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt11" id="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>I found myself having thought-provoking conversations with &nbsp;twenty-somethings.

&nbsp; Can I get the teacher to carry me like that again, so I can check it out further?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Despite repeated </span><span>obstreperous </span><span class="c1">behaviour in kindergarten, I don&rsquo;t manage this feat, so I decide on some independent research. &nbsp; I play doctor with the little girl down the street - we compare anatomical observations and see some differences. &nbsp; She&rsquo;s curious about my tiny little penis, that I stick out instead of in. &nbsp;I notice that her slit is much smoother and lighter than my kindergarten teacher&rsquo;s. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m curious to see if this pattern is the same for other girls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next time I test it out with Lucy, a girl from a few blocks over. &nbsp;We go to her room, and just as we are getting into the detailed examination of all of the salient bits, her mom comes into her room. &nbsp;The mom is not at all happy. &nbsp; She yells at us to STOP!! and get dressed IMMEDIATELY!! and demands an apology.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Lucy complies, in tears, but anti-authoritarian that I am, I refuse. &nbsp;I will not say I&rsquo;m sorry. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t see what I should be sorry about. &nbsp;I was just doing science, and I know that science is a good thing (even though I have an inkling that this kind of science is sensitive and best done in private). &nbsp; It&rsquo;s a standoff, and the mom demands that I stay in the little girl&rsquo;s room alone to think &nbsp;about it. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not to come out until I&rsquo;m willing to apologize. &nbsp; </span><span>I hunker down, alone in the room, grimly eying the walls and plotting my revenge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Time passes, maybe an hour or more. &nbsp;Lucy&rsquo;s mom checks in every so often to see if I&rsquo;m ready to cave. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not, and I tell her so vehemently. &nbsp; Eventually, perhaps getting desperate not to lose face, she proffers a compromise: &nbsp;If I&rsquo;m willing to say that I want to play a game of </span><span class="c6">Sorry!</span><span>&nbsp;with Lucy, she&rsquo;ll let me out. &nbsp; &nbsp;I consider this proposal for a while. &nbsp;Clearly my adversary has taken a few steps toward me, allowing me to satisfy her demand without really apologizing. &nbsp; She has given me an out. &nbsp; I still don&rsquo;t like the deal - it smacks of caving, and I don&rsquo;t feel that I was in the wrong. &nbsp;But I don&rsquo;t really have a better </span><span>option, I&rsquo;m getting hungry,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s a kind of partial victory over a grownup, even if my ego comes out a bit bruised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mutter under my voice that I&rsquo;d like to play &ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; and the relieved mom lets me come out &hellip; Lucy and I play perfunctorily for a short time, and then when appearances have been satisfied, I beetle out of there and head home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sheepishly tell my mom something of what happened. &nbsp; She obliquely and mildly chastises me, saying that I mustn&rsquo;t do anything to upset the other mothers. &nbsp;She doesn&rsquo;t outright tell me that playing doctor was wrong, but she&rsquo;s clearly not happy that I did so, and even more so that I got caught. &nbsp;The tacit subtext is that there is something a bit shameful about what I did. &nbsp;Not exactly sinful, but really Not Done. &nbsp; Quite Inappropriate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After some deliberation, I decide to park my research. &nbsp; This is apparently something for later - Only for Grown Ups, perhaps?

Lindo&rsquo;s a Faggot!&rdquo; &nbsp;They would laugh and point. &nbsp; &nbsp;I discovered that being shoved along a row of lockers wasn&rsquo;t fun at all when the locks all protruded. &nbsp; Bruises and abrasions and sometimes a torn uniform were likely to ensue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was this horrible thing, a &ldquo;fag&rdquo;? &nbsp;And was I a faggot? &nbsp;The other boys sure seemed to think so. &nbsp;And it seemed that not everybody was labeled this way, just me and a few others. &nbsp; Maybe I was a faggot, and just didn&rsquo;t know it yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually I figured out what this was. &nbsp;A faggot was a boy who liked boys! &nbsp; Who maybe put his middle finger up another boy&rsquo;s bum! &nbsp; And some people even said that they would put their penises up another boy&#39;s bum! &nbsp;(I had a hard time believing that; penises didn&rsquo;t seem anywhere stiff enough to push up a bum hole.) &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t fathom why anyone would want to do that. &nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t know if I liked girls, so maybe I was a Faggot, and I didn&rsquo;t know it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was stressful. &nbsp;What would I do if I turned out to be this thing, this thing I came to understand was being Homosexual. &nbsp;Or as they started to call it around then, Gay. &nbsp; It would be terrible! &nbsp;Everyone would hate me!</span></p><p class="c0"><span>As time went on I started to enter puberty. &nbsp; One day, I was playing in my room, putting a sock over my penis and sliding it off, repeatedly. &nbsp; Even to me this seemed like a weird pastime but I kinda liked how it felt: &nbsp;there was a lovely friction as the sock slid off the shaft of my penis. &nbsp;I noticed that my little penis got a bit larger and firmer as I did this, which was intriguing. &nbsp;And I noticed that as this experimentation proceeded, the sensations became stronger and more pleasurable. &nbsp; After a few minutes of this, I was shocked to feel a sudden warm surge in my groin and dismayed to see a large drop of warm, sticky white fluid emerge from the tip of my penis, threatening to make the sock wet. &nbsp; I knew enough to realize that this was semen, and I realized to my surprise that I had just masturbated! &nbsp;This thing that I had read about but apparently hadn&rsquo;t fully understood.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; (I had understood that masturbation involved touching one&rsquo;s genitals, but not that this could translate into orgasm and ejaculation.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With puberty, I started to notice girls. &nbsp;I started to notice, in particular, that girls had breasts emerging from their chests. &nbsp; It was hard to tell, because I mostly saw them from a distance, but I was pretty sure that they were turning into women.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I noticed, to my relief, that I was really interested in that! &nbsp;In fact, I really liked girls! &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t a Faggot, after all! &nbsp;Phew!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this happy awareness, I was able confidently shut down my attention to boys for any kind of connection, because I Wasn&rsquo;t A Faggot. &nbsp; Boys were for fighting against and controlling and beating at math. &nbsp; Girls were for &hellip; well, I wasn&rsquo;t sure, exactly, because I hadn&rsquo;t really been around one for years, but I thought it was nice stuff. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d heard about this sex thing, and I was pretty sure that girls were for that, at least sometimes. &nbsp; And maybe sometimes for wearing nice dresses and corsages and stuff.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At Harvard, I finally had the chance to check out the theory that I liked women.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During the fall, I asked out a jock woman who wore cute sweaters and came from Dedham in the Boston area, so she said things like &ldquo;I paahked the caah in the paahkin lot&rdquo; unironically. &nbsp;After a chaste date or two, she stopped saying yes to my invitations&hellip; later I figured out I wasn&rsquo;t moving fast enough for her taste. &nbsp;But I didn&rsquo;t know any better.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then I became fixated on Mary Jessica Collins, known universally as MJC, a Southern girl with long, wavy red hair, alabaster skin, green eyes, perfect preppy clothing, and an upper class Virginian drawl to die for. &nbsp; She was the best, way out of my league, gorgeous and smart. &nbsp; Students would trail along beside her, recording her wise utterances and bon mots for posterity.

I was surprised at how wet and hairy she was when I eventually slid my hand under Sigrid&rsquo;s panties and between her legs, but I liked it, and I liked how she moaned, and that she enjoyed it so much. &nbsp; When she came there were a series of little popping sounds - I imagined it was her cervix opening and closing like a little round mouth as the orgasmic waves went through her. &nbsp; Then she pulled my cock out of my pants and played with it with her hand, to my surprise and delight. &nbsp; I groaned loudly the first time I came - she vigorously shushed me. &nbsp; What would the other students think about her if they heard me? &nbsp;I learned to be quieter, to pretend I was masturbating at summer camp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I took her skating. &nbsp;Showing off while she stood gingerly at center ice, &nbsp;I skated directly at her at high speed and did a dramatic hockey-style stop directly in front of her. &nbsp;Except&hellip; &nbsp;I misjudged slightly, and instead of stopping a foot short of her, my skates slid hard under her and abruptly catapulted her legs out from under her, leaving her body suspended in mid air for a moment, like the coyote after having raced off the edge of a cliff. &nbsp;Unfortunately, she must have looked down, because she fell heavily in a startled heap on top of me, crushing me painfully, the two of us sliding in an ungainly</span><span>&nbsp;mass across the ice, arms and legs protruding awkwardly.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t entirely impressed. &nbsp;My ego was badly bruised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sigrid gave me a house plant that she claimed was unkillable - that even </span><span>I couldn&rsquo;t possibly kil</span><span>l - &nbsp;and headed home for a week. &nbsp;On her return the plant </span><span>had wilted and turned brown and grey and &nbsp;lost most of its leaves,</span><sup><a href="#cmnt14" id="cmnt_ref14">[n]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;despite my attempts to water it as instructed. &nbsp; It drooped, moribund, leaves shriveled and shedding. &nbsp;When she saw it, the corners of her mouth turned down and teased me mercilessly. &nbsp;I was abashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our relationship, founded on desperate, inexperienced sexual exploration and not much else, gradually petered out after several weeks of fumbling - perhaps the plant was an omen. &nbsp;On the day that we decided to call it quits, she told me that she had found out that the type of houseplant she had given me was, indeed, quite robust, but would abruptly go into dormancy after flowering. &nbsp; Maybe there was hope for me if I pulled it out of the trash and watered it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The summer between freshman and sophomore year, 1982, I went home to Montreal. &nbsp; I had a summer job working for a professor of wind engineering at McCord University. &nbsp;I worked with (and often in) a huge wind tunnel, taking air speed measurements and writing computer programs to analyze the results. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>There was a group of 6 or so other young college age students, all working for various engineering professors at the lab. &nbsp; We all became quite close, often picnicking together for lunch at a nearby urban park or church yard. &nbsp; I found myself spending a lot of time with one of them, Jessie. &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;She was a beautiful, serene, thoughtful girl, with dark brown hair and a warm complexion, soft, warm eyes, and a reserved smile. &nbsp;She was a French horn player and computer major, quiet and intelligent..</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We started to hang out together, sometimes after work. &nbsp; One day the whole group went out together to celebrate the end of their six week internship - </span><span>we went to Chinatown and had a huge dinner. &nbsp;And it was a BYOB place, and we had wine, and became high spirited, laughing uproariously and trading loud comments across the table..</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterward, as we walked along St. Denis in downtown Montreal, I was bouncing along boisterously and talking loudly, causing people coming the other way to give me a wide berth. &nbsp; Jessie took exception: &nbsp; &ldquo;Bobby, quiet please! You&rsquo;re embarrassing me!&rdquo; &nbsp; I could have settled down, but I refused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterwards, she spoke to me firmly, disappointed and embarrassed, telling me that she didn&rsquo;t want me to be like that, and that I would need to stop if I wanted to be around her. &nbsp; &nbsp;I thought about this, and answered (sadly? defiantly?), &ldquo;Sorry, but this is who I am. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t change that for you. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll just have to accept me this way if you want to be around me.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I assumed that this was it, that this serene girl would have had enough &hellip; but apparently not, a</span><span>s, to my surprise, she kept on agreeing to see me</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp; Apparently the little tiff and my refusal to compromise wasn&rsquo;t enough of a deterrent..</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We continued to see each other after the work term ended. &nbsp;I would drive to her house in Outremont, and we would</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;sit on the sofa,</span><span>&nbsp;and talk, and kiss, </span><span class="c9">and make out. &nbsp;</span><span>Things moved slowly &hellip; our clothing stayed on, for a long time. &nbsp;But we would touch each other&rsquo;s bodies through the clothing. &nbsp;One time I rubbed her corduroy-covered </span><span>clitoral region</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;so vigorously and at such length that I ended up with a large blister on my index fingertip; I think a wisp of smoke emanated from my fingertip when I pulled it away from her crotch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Eventually our clothing started to slowly come off. &nbsp;We would </span><span class="c9">make out for hours late at night on her sofa,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;testing the boundaries of heavy petting. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d slide my hands under her sweater to fondle her breasts, and then eventually down her belly, opening the front of her pants, and then inside her panties to stroke her warm pussy. I remember that one radio deejay would often play &ldquo;Twenty Five or Six to Four&rdquo; by Chicago at about 3:34 am, and we would catch the joke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One late, slightly rainy night coming home from Jessie&rsquo;s, driving on deserted highways, I &nbsp;accelerated hard around a corner coming out of a traffic circle &hellip; the slight rain after a long dry spell had lubricated the oil and tire dust smeared on the road, leaving a greasy, slippery mess. &nbsp; The tail end of the heavy rear-wheel-drive car spun out as the wheels skidded, and I went sideways through a fence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A helpful bystander, suspecting alcohol was involved, &nbsp;made a citizen&rsquo;s arrest, grabbing me by the arm, and called the cops &hellip; they came, took down the details, and sent me home, free but mortified. &nbsp;(There was no alcohol, only testosterone and stupidity). &nbsp; My summer&rsquo;s wages went toward paying for the car to be repaired.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt15" id="cmnt_ref15">[o]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;I was ashamed of my error, but repaying my dad for the damage to the car &nbsp;assuaged my guilt a little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The relationship with Jessie continued through my sophomore year at Harvard. &nbsp; Jessie and I would write long letters to each other, which took over a week to travel each way between Boston and Montreal. &nbsp;She visited me once or twice at Harvard, and I saw her each time I came home. &nbsp;She became good friends with my parents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During the second summer of our relationship, back in Montreal, I started to wonder if I was in love with Jessie. &nbsp;I noticed the warm and fuzzy feelings I had when I was around her, how good it felt to have my arm around her, how nice her laugh sounded, how much I liked her smile. &nbsp;We started to get a bit more adventurous with our sexual explorations: no intercourse, but we were often getting mostly or fully naked, and we&rsquo;d even, uncertainly, tried out oral sex once or twice. &nbsp; Did all this add up to love?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started to wonder if she reciprocated my feelings. &nbsp;She never seemed to say anything one way or the other. &nbsp;She was kind and gentle and nice to be around. &nbsp;But was there love?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As summer came to an end, I started to wonder: What would happen if I loved her and she didn&rsquo;t love me? &nbsp;What would happen if I went back to school and she left me? &nbsp;DId I really love her, anyway? &nbsp;What did I feel about her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the last week of summer, I had convinced myself that this relationship wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere, that Jessie didn&rsquo;t really love me, and that I didn&rsquo;t want to find out when she ended it in a month, that I wanted to be free to date other women. &nbsp; So I ended the relationship, telling her that it felt like it had had its time. &nbsp;I felt slightly sad, but that I had done the right thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We continued to correspond for a little while after I went back to Harvard. &nbsp; After a letter telling me about how sad she felt about the breakup, and how she was burying herself in her studies, and her music, another followed, telling me that she was spending a bit of time with a trombonist she had met. &nbsp; Then another came telling me that she had started dating the trombonist. &nbsp; Then no more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was devastated: &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t love me after all! &nbsp;I was right! &nbsp;But I loved her, and I&rsquo;d made a mistake! &nbsp;I should have never ended it! &nbsp; I grieved, and grieved, judging myself for the next two years that I had blown it, that I&rsquo;d pushed away a perfectly lovely woman, a woman who had instantly found another partner - and I couldn&rsquo;t, I had no idea what to do. &nbsp;I was convinced that I had made the biggest mistake of my life. &nbsp;I wallowed in misery.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next couple of years were a wasteland, lovewise. &nbsp; I never dated. &nbsp;Instead, &nbsp;I started a student magazine about the interaction of art and science, and threw my heart and soul into it &hellip; I recruited contributors and got funding and worked my ass off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I found myself working closely with the managing editor, a short, preppy girl named Leah Allston. &nbsp;She was cute and smart and had determination and grit. &nbsp;She wore nicely fitting woolen sweaters that showed off her figure to fine effect. &nbsp;She also obviously came from a social stratum at least a level or two beyond mine. &nbsp;She was clearly Out Of My League, maybe not as far out as MJC, but still out.. &nbsp;But nonetheless I had a crush on her, despite the fact that she ignored me. &nbsp;</span><span>I saw not the slightest sign of interest in me</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;When we were together, which was often, she would affect a haughty air, chin raised, often looking off into the distance..</span></p><p class="c0"><span>One day after some months of working together she invited me to her dorm room to work on editing an issue of our publication. &nbsp;We worked side by side at her computer for a few minutes. &nbsp;Leah was sitting at the keyboard, and I was sitting slightly behind her, smelling her light, floral perfume and noticing her brown hair trailing, enticingly over the nape of her neck, and the fetching curve of her back. &nbsp;Then after only a few minutes, well before we were done, she said she was tired of this, and pulled away from the desk. &nbsp; I was</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">irritated, because we clearly weren&rsquo;t done. &nbsp;She flopped back on her bed, on her elbows, the front of her tight sweater protruding toward me fetchingly, her legs slightly splayed, lolling about. &nbsp;She looked sexy as hell. &nbsp; &nbsp;I ran my eyes over her body, momentarily, then caught myself staring and looked away from her breasts and the space between her legs.. &nbsp; Then she glared at me, with an angry, aggressive expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was confused. &nbsp;What had I done to get her angry? Did I say the wrong thing? &nbsp;Why was she putting herself into this provocative pose and then snarling at me? &nbsp; Was she daring me to make a move, or really pissed off? &nbsp; I asked her what she wanted, and she looked down demurely and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;,&rdquo; and her voice trailed off. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Baffled, I wondered what to do for a few minutes, hemming and hawing, getting no further clarity from Leah. &nbsp;When nothing changed, I excused myself in frustration and left. &nbsp;On the way home I was pissed off. &nbsp;I thought of signals, and how women expected us men to read them, and how contrary and conflicting they could be. &nbsp;Why couldn&rsquo;t women be clear? &nbsp;Why couldn&rsquo;t they just say what they meant? &nbsp;Why couldn&rsquo;t she have asked me to sit beside her, or to go away, instead of being so confusing, what with the provocative pose combined with the hostile expression?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leah Allston shortly thereafter dropped out as managing editor of my student publication.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Almost thirty years later I read in the newspaper about a psychology </span><span class="c9">study </span><span>that had just been published. &nbsp;They had </span><span class="c9">studied </span><span>college-age men and their ability to </span><span class="c9">recognize </span><span>the emotions in photographs of college-age women&rsquo;s faces. &nbsp;They had found that the young men had a really hard time </span><span class="c9">interpreting </span><span>some facial expressions. &nbsp;More specifically, it said that the men somehow had a less than random chance of correctly </span><span class="c9">identifying </span><span>between anger and lust, confusing the two more often than not. &nbsp;This seemed like it could be problematic for dating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck. &nbsp; Finally, after three decades, the penny dropped. &nbsp;Leah Allston, sweater girl, object of my unrequited lust for months, had done her utmost to seduce me. &nbsp;She had navigated me into her dorm room, got me to sit close by her, then when I hadn&rsquo;t put m hadn&rsquo;t put my arm around her, she had lain seductively on her bed with the most ravishing look of lust and desire that she could summon up on her pretty face. &nbsp; And I had walked out on her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck!!</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My student publication did eventually get me laid, kind of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leah&rsquo;s successor as business manager for my student paper was Oomya Nawadi, a six foot tall Nigerian princess with her black hair in long cornrows and a sassy attitude. &nbsp;Oomya got what she wanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The summer between junior and senior year I stayed in Cambridge to work a summer job at the Harvard Law School. &nbsp; One evening Oomya invited herself over for dinner to the apartment I shared with three other students. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We had a forgettable student repast, then we all repaired to the living room. &nbsp;Oomya pulled out a joint and offered me some. My roommates countered, bringing out a fully-loaded bong. Square that I was, I&rsquo;d never smoked up before, but I decided to give it a try, taking a few long puffs from the bong and earning a very, very long coughing spell. &nbsp; Things got a little relaxed. &nbsp;Oomya and I moved to my bedroom&hellip; we lay on my bed &hellip; next thing somehow both of us were naked and I was lying on her ebony body, feeling surprised at this rapid turn of events. &nbsp; I felt her warm skin and long, narrow breasts and ran my hand into her rough-feeling, damp groin. &nbsp;It all felt so different from Jessie and Sigrid.. &nbsp;She looked and smelled and felt different, but it was interesting &hellip;And all of a sudden my cock was hard and sliding loosely into her pussy, &nbsp;and I realized with shock that this was the first time my life I was actually having sex, and with a woman that I never in my wildest imagination expected to be doing this with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And instantly Oomya vigorously pushed me off her, and she was saying, &ldquo;Damn, I don&rsquo;t have a condom. &nbsp;Do you have one?&rdquo; &nbsp; I&rsquo;d barely even realized I was having sex (or was I? &nbsp;Did I even get fully in? &nbsp;Does it count if it&rsquo;s just the tip?) before it ended. &nbsp;Because of course I did not have a condom. &nbsp;It had never occurred to me that I might need one. &nbsp; And our unexpected sexual adventure ground to an instant stop with &nbsp;an uncomfortable laugh, to be followed in the coming weeks &nbsp;an awkward set of chaste working encounters, and the smirks and raised eyebrows of my roommates, who had seen me (apparently) ravished by this Amazon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that was it. &nbsp; &nbsp;The next year I spent most evenings at the physics lab researching chaos theory, or working on my student magazine, eschewing parties and avoiding getting to know people. &nbsp; No dating ensued. &nbsp; Four years of university and so little to show for it, sexual adventuring-wise.

Silicon controlled rectifiers!) for various projects. &nbsp; So it seemed natural that I got interested in the new home computer craze that began then. &nbsp; Each month I eagerly awaited my Popular Science magazine, and &nbsp;I read about the &nbsp;Altair 8800 and IMSAI 8080. &nbsp;I badly wanted one for myself. &nbsp;Radio Shack came out with the TRS-80 and then personal computing really took off with the Commodore Pet. &nbsp; And yet still hadn&rsquo;t even seen a home computer up close - they were way too expensive for my family&rsquo;s meager budget.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>But about grade 8 I was introduced to computing at the QPS computer lab. &nbsp;</span><span>They had a weird Hewlett Packard &ldquo;programmable calculator&rdquo; that looked like a squashed home computer with a 2 line display. &nbsp;You could program it in BASIC, either penciling in the dots on a series of punch cards, or if you were lucky, typing it in one line at a time on the computer&rsquo;s keyboard. &nbsp; Keyboard time was reserved for older students and in 15 minute slots. &nbsp; </span><span class="c1">I was jonesing for my first fix.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The first few times I got access to the computer I was hooked. &nbsp;I had an enormous fascination with getting this dumb inanimate object to do my bidding. &nbsp;I felt clever and powerful and accomplished, particularly when I compared what I was achieving to my classmates. &nbsp; I quickly signed up for after-school access. &nbsp;The computer had a printer/plotter that would print out slick graphs, rolling the paper up and down while banging out the graph axes and data values, buzzing and whirring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Around this time I first played a board game called &ldquo;Ogre&rdquo;, which was a bit like &ldquo;Battleships&rdquo; but with tanks. &nbsp;You moved a paper token representing a tank around on a hexagonal grid and took shots at your enemy. &nbsp; I realized that you could make a much better version of this game using the computer. &nbsp; You could enter the direction of travel of your tank, and the direction of shooting, and try to shoot your enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>So I immediately started programming this relatively complicated game. &nbsp;I quickly realized that I needed some trigonometry to work out where the tank would go and where the shots would go, based on the angle of travel. &nbsp;I wrote out my BASIC program in long hand, dozens or hundreds of lines of code, then would go to the computer lab at my allotted time slot to feverishly type in as much as I could until my time ran out. &nbsp;I could feel a thrum of energy in my body as I worked on the computer. &nbsp;I had a blast working out how to graph the tank map and track where everything was. &nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t wait to try it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a few weeks, I started to test the game. &nbsp;First time I ran it, it quickly ground to a halt with a bug. &nbsp; I ran it a few times to debug it and get it working properly. &nbsp;Once it was running, the game map would dance up and down in the plotter, the print head hammering out a series of straight and wavy lines, point by point. &nbsp;I would watch, rapt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; But when I finally played the game all the way through, a funny thing happened: &nbsp;I realized that playing it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as much fun as I expected. &nbsp;Sure, it did what I wanted, but the game wasn&rsquo;t actually all that interesting. &nbsp; &nbsp;I had a pang of dismay: &nbsp;all this delightful anticipation of the enjoyment of playing the game wasn&rsquo;t matched by reality. All that work didn&rsquo;t result in an amazing playing experience. &nbsp;Disappointed, I played it a couple of times and put it away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was funny, though - I kept thinking back to writing the game, and how fun that was. &nbsp;I resolved to find another game, or another project, that I could work on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Over the coming years, I got more chances to work with programming computers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the McCord University Building Studies Institute, I began working on a summer research assistantship, a plum position I&rsquo;d won based on a city-wide competition, with Dr. Christos Stephanopoulos, &nbsp;professor of wind engineering. &nbsp;Dr. Stephanopoulos was calibrating a large, new environmental wind tunnel he intended to use to refine building codes for building design. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He asked me to &nbsp;painstakingly collect thousands of wind speed measurements centimeters apart (using simple pitot tubes and a manometer, or a precise and fragile hot wire anemometer). &nbsp;It sounded like tedious, time-comsuming work, so I set myself up to do it in an organized and efficient routine, to get it over more quickly. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I got into a rhythm, starting the wind tunnel each morning while I noshed on a croissant, then settled into a long spell of measuring. &nbsp;I would position the instrument, allow the readings to settle, record the observation in a notepad,, and then repeat the procedure. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stephanopoulos went away for a few weeks to a conference to pick up new ideas. &nbsp; I felt a tad abandoned, but decided to focus on my work. &nbsp;By the time he was back, I surprised him by reporting the measurements were almost done. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d expected that I&rsquo;d be at it all summer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;Somewhat at a loss, he challenged me to analyze and tabulate the results, presenting them in the form of charts and graphs, and calculating &nbsp;the characteristic exponent representing how the wind speed slowed toward the ground.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; He explained the math that I would need to do. &nbsp;It amounted to thousands of calculations. &nbsp;Uggh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>T</span><span class="c1">hese detailed calculations on hundreds of readings seemed like it would be even more tedious than taking the measurements. &nbsp;I pondered this new assignment with dismay: &nbsp;more tedium. &nbsp;Not at all what I wanted. &nbsp;So, reasoning that computers were good at this kind of repetitive work, &nbsp;I decided to see if I could write a computer program to do all these calculations for me. &nbsp;It might not be any faster than doing the calculations myself, but it promised to be more fun.. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My initial attempt was a bit disastrous: &nbsp;the first version of the program was accidentally wiped out when the mainframe computer crashed before I had saved it.. &nbsp; I feverishly typed it back in before I forgot what I had written. &nbsp;I pressed &ldquo;save&rdquo; &hellip;. And there was a pause. &nbsp;Nothing happened. &nbsp; As the moments passed, a hollow feeling formed in the pit of my stomach. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>Soon the ugly truth became clear: &nbsp;The mainframe once again had gone down, taking my code with it. &nbsp;The other denizens of the computer terminal room, each hunched over a large, dark terminal, were suddenly startled by a loud bang as I banged the metal cover of the computer terminal in frustration.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; Heads flew around, and jaws dropped. &nbsp;The sharp pain in my hand reflected the emotional pain of the loss of my work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But over time I got the hang of saving my work as I went, and I soon made rapid progress. &nbsp;By the end of the summer I&rsquo;d fully analyzed the numbers that I&rsquo;d collected, and generated a series of charts and graphs mapping and profiling the wind flow through the wind tunnel. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Very satisfied with this progress, Dr. Stephanopoulos asked me over the coming few summers to come back to work on ever more complex problems. &nbsp;I would capture detailed observations about wind fluctuating wind pressures on model buildings. &nbsp; And then I would write computer programs to analyze the work, looking at characteristics like the power spectrum and the distribution of peak pressures. &nbsp;We identified that the most extreme (and dangerous) peak pressures occurred much more frequently than would be expected by traditional normal distributions, which meant that the existing building codes might not be sufficiently strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The work was challenging and rewarding, and my prof was pleased with my progress. &nbsp;By the third year, my work resulted in enough answers to let us co-author a paper published in a refereed engineering journal.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;My chest puffed out in pride when I finally received a reprint of the paper.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>After a couple of years at Harvard, I started doing some software there. I took a couple of computer science classes, including the notorious CS150, which dug into systems programming (tree &nbsp;and hash indexes, assemblers, compression algorithms, etc.) in gory detail. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">It was famously the hardest undergraduate course at Harvard, as voted year after year by student course evaluation surveys.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CS 150 involved a major project every week or two, in which students would need to learn a new skill (like a new programming language, or a new kind of algorithm) and then design, write, debug, and document a computer program to solve the given problem. &nbsp;Each week there were six or eight hours of lectures and sections, followed by many hours of programing and debugging time, as we worked out how to tell this very stupid piece of equipment in precise detail how to do something rather clever. &nbsp;Often I needed to work late into the evening on cramped terminals in the computer lab to complete the assignments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp; I enjoyed the intellectual challenge of the assignments, if not always the many, many hours of work.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; But it was a great feeling to hand in a completed assignment with a working program that accomplished the stated goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Then &nbsp;I got a part time job at Harvard Law Instruction (</span><span>HLI</span><span class="c1">) at the Harvard Law School. &nbsp; HLI &nbsp;was teaching law students about courtroom procedure by playing snippets of trials on video and asking them to object to impermissible cross-examination techniques.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The programming, in a language called Turbo Pascal was fast and simple, and Turbo was a cool interactive development environment that instantly took programmers right to the line of a bug. &nbsp;Turbo was wonderful - but it was designed for small programs, and as ours grew ever larger and required a recompilation on each error, things began to bog down. &nbsp; Working at HLI over the summer between junior and senior year, I took it upon myself to develop a kind of library linker, which allowed the large HLI libraries to be compiled once and then just linked in when compiling the code for each course. &nbsp; This clever programming sped up the compile process by a factor of 10 or so for typical changes, making development significantly more efficient.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; I thought that doing this might impress the (cute, female) president of HLI, but, alas, she had other priorities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>This project turned out to be a portent of things to come: &nbsp;I took a piece of software that worked ok, but was a bit slow and clunky, dug down into its underpinnings to understand what was happening, then did some clever programming to speed it up by an order of magnitude, making it sing. &nbsp; I found myself doing this again and again throughout my career as a programmer&hellip; that wasn&rsquo;t my only programming trick, but probably the nerdiest.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt16" id="cmnt_ref16">[p]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>As I approached graduation, I realized that I didn&rsquo;t want to continue on in Physics, at least not right away. &nbsp;Physics in the US was contracting due to spending cuts as the cold war came to an end, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I wanted to be an academic in a cost-cutting environment.. &nbsp; I kicked the tires of other career options - for instance I interviewed for a position as a consultant with McKinsey, but I wanted a position in Toronto and they had nothing there at the moment&hellip; by the time I decided I was willing to go to NYC, they had filled all their spots. &nbsp;So I considered what else I might do, and programming seemed to be an option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jobs back home in Montreal seemed few, and preference was being given to people whose first language was French, so I decided to aim for a spot in Toronto. &nbsp; Eventually, not long before graduation, I got a job working for the National Pacific </span><span>Railway</span><span>&nbsp;information technology department in Toronto, working on train dispatching and MIS projects.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt17" id="cmnt_ref17">[q]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>My first assignment was to work on an executive management information system. &nbsp;We were supposed to make a graphical overview display showing train delays across the entire NP system - the Executive Work Station. &nbsp;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt18" id="cmnt_ref18">[r]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;A very clever programmer had written his own little programming language to make it easier to configure the displays, and the small team I was working on was using that programming language to code the displays. &nbsp; </span><span>As those displays became more and more complicated, we spent hours waiting for our programs to slowly compile. &nbsp;These delays slowed our progress and threatened our deadline.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt19" id="cmnt_ref19">[s]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>I&rsquo;d never written a compiler, but I had some idea about algorithms and data structures, so I dug into the compiler to see if I could optimize it. &nbsp; &nbsp;First thing I noticed was that it used a linear symbol lookup, so as the program got bigger compiling slowed down dramatically. &nbsp; A quick little hashtable sped up compiling by a huge factor. &nbsp;Then with a few more tweaks, like switching from character input/output to block, I ended up speeding up the compiler by close to 10 times over the next couple of days. &nbsp;This made our development fly, and let a colleague </span><span class="c9">rapidly </span><span>finish the rest of the development. &nbsp;We </span><span class="c9">rapidly </span><span>refined the executive workstation, and the executives loved our work. &nbsp;

Mystified, I asked why. &nbsp; He told me that my colleague, Ian, was there working on debugging some safety critical train dispatching software during a &ldquo;tiger team&rdquo; testing session, and he was stressed out. &nbsp;Could I go there, hold his hand, take him out to dinner when he needed it, and generally keep things on track?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wasn&rsquo;t at all sure I could do this.

More of the testers gathered around to watch. &nbsp; It felt like people were holding their breath, collectively. &nbsp;Then at 10, </span><span class="c9">it failed,</span><span>&nbsp;and there was a groan&hellip;. It wasn&rsquo;t enough, but it was the first real, meaningful progress we&rsquo;d made, and it felt exciting. &nbsp;Everyone agreed that the performance was fine. &nbsp; There were some smiles, and a few high fives &hellip; even Ian, who had come over in the middle of this, &nbsp;looked excited and optimistic. &nbsp;His skepticism had vanished.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt48" id="cmnt_ref48">[av]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>Ian took over from me, playing with the loader overlay map like a confident maestro, using his deep knowledge of how the software worked, and his new understanding of how overlays could help. &nbsp; After an hour or two of compiling and overlay testing and debugging, &nbsp;we ran another big test, while everyone watched&hellip;. The tension mounted as train after train was added, and tested &nbsp; &hellip; a huge cheer erupted when we hit 15, and then only a mild groan and some laughter when the software immediately crashed. &nbsp; And after some more brainstorming and a few more hours of tweaking, Ian consistently got over &nbsp;20 trains to work correctly, which was well over the requirement. &nbsp; We had made it! &nbsp; The only remaining issues were little nuisances that were simple but tedious to fix, things like formatting printouts more cleanly. &nbsp;Ian was elated, the testers were full of smiles, and I was hugely relieved that this surprising few days tha</span><span>t looked so unpromising had come out so well.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt49" id="cmnt_ref49">[aw]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ian and I flew home to the congratulations of Hugo and the rest of the team.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>***</span><sup><a href="#cmnt50" id="cmnt_ref50">[ax]</a></sup></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After these successes, Hugo assigned me to work on train dispatching software.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>For a while I worked on the system that I had helped Ian debug in Montreal that day. &nbsp; It was used for dispatching branch lines and spurs, areas where it wasn&rsquo;t worth putting in full signaling systems. &nbsp;Once computerization was added, those branches became much more productive, so there was a big pressure to add it everywhere that wasn&rsquo;t signaled (or, as they called it on the railroad, dark territory.) &nbsp;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt51" id="cmnt_ref51">[ay]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c28 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After this success, we were given a chance with the big leagues, centralized traffic control or CTC, &nbsp;which was used to control the main line, places where the overhead signals controlled the train flow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Hugo sold the business on the idea of developing our own CTC control workstation using PCs with large, Mitsubishi or NEC monitors with high resolution Matrox graphics cards. &nbsp;At the time this was very high technology, with over $10,000 worth of display technology per workstation, what seemed like an enormous amount of money. &nbsp;But each workstation would replace a $100,000 manually wired wall-sized track display, and it would allow one dispatcher to more easily manage several subdivisions, without moving around. &nbsp; This could help save money by reducing the number of dispatchers on off-peak times.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt52" id="cmnt_ref52">[az]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>Hugo started setting up the large, complicated project.. &nbsp; He had been assigned some project leaders from the mainframe development group, and broke the project into several teams. &nbsp; My team worked on some of the low level system programming, like interfacing with the Matrox card and the CTC. &nbsp;Another team, led by Ron Piggott, a mainframe project leader who was a whiz with Cobol, &nbsp;worked on the user interface. &nbsp;Others worked on the routing, the mainframe database interface, and other problems.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt53" id="cmnt_ref53">[ba]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>My team did its job, and so did the others, but the user interface team had highly visible problems. &nbsp;Its displays worked correctly, but they refreshed excruciatingly slowly. &nbsp;Whenever we demoed the system to users, like dispatchers and superintendents, they shook their heads and said that it wouldn&rsquo;t work in real life. &nbsp; They talked about how much faster the (much cruder and more expensive) displays from the signals companies worked, and how quickly dispatchers needed to be able to respond.. &nbsp;Meanwhile, political conflicts between the different team leaders festered, particularly between the mainframe people and the PC people.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt54" id="cmnt_ref54">[bb]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>This dragged on and on, and it put the project at risk - clearly we weren&rsquo;t making the performance needs of the business problem. &nbsp; &nbsp;I complained in project meetings that Ron Piggott&rsquo;s team was using floating point math - and that this ran much, much slower on PCs of the day than integer math. &nbsp; I told them they were going to need to switch to integer. &nbsp; Ron resisted, saying that doing this would take weeks to rewrite the software and cause his team to miss its deadline. &nbsp; And besides, there was no guarantee that this would fix the problem. &nbsp; The displays continued to lag.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt55" id="cmnt_ref55">[bc]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>Eventually, frustrated by the lack of understanding by Ron and the lack of support from Hugo, I took matters into my own hands. &nbsp; Staying late after work one Friday night, I started programming a demo in the C programming language, written using integer math, with most of the calculations offloaded to the powerful Matrox graphics board. &nbsp;I worked in a frenzy, noticing how quickly and smoothly my demo was going. &nbsp; I worked hour after hour, eventually staying until Saturday morning. &nbsp;By the time I was done, I had a demo that would zoom from a full subdivision view with a dozen stations, all the way into a single station siding view, refreshing as fast as a user could press the &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; key. &nbsp;It flew like the wind.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt56" id="cmnt_ref56">[bd]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday morning I showed Hugo my demo. &nbsp; He hummed appreciatively. He called Ron over, who watched it, looking green with disgust and dismay. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>There was a huge eclat in the project. &nbsp; Once they saw the changes, the end users were delighted. Ron&rsquo;s team had to rewrite their software according to my ideas. &nbsp;Ron stopped speaking to me, and glared at me every time he saw me. &nbsp; </span><span>I savored my triumph, but I also noticed the tension, and how it tightened my belly to be around Ron.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt57" id="cmnt_ref57">[be]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That project continued to have problems. &nbsp; There were conflicts between the client side team and the server team. &nbsp;Things didn&rsquo;t connect. &nbsp;Schedules didn&rsquo;t align. &nbsp; People talked about other people behind their backs. &nbsp; I felt more and more stressed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually I took matters into my own hands again, with my first foray into addressing office politics. &nbsp; I somehow decided to try openness, in my own inimitable style.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ended up writing an email in the form of a project newsletter. &nbsp;It was called &ldquo;All the project dirt.&rdquo; &nbsp;And it dished the dirt. &nbsp;It shared all the conflicts, and backstabbing, and disagreements, and failures. &nbsp; It put it all into light. &nbsp;It named names, and highlighted faults and mistakes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in a fit of brilliance, one evening I sent this loaded missive to the entire project team.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To my surprise, the project team&rsquo;s reaction to this flash of brilliant light was not what I expected. &nbsp; Instead of everybody reacting with relief that someone had finally said the emperor had no clothes, I found myself in a grim and silent office the next day. &nbsp;No one said a word. &nbsp;No one looked at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually Hugo called me into his office. &nbsp;He was curious, he said, looking at &ldquo;All the project dirt&rdquo; on his computer, what had caused me to write all of this, and to decide to share it with the whole project team. &nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t deny that any of it was true, but he asked me to consider how sharing the steamy load of ickiness might have made the other project leaders feel, and how it might have affected their ability to lead their teams. &nbsp; He asked me to consider whether what I had done was helpful. &nbsp;As he haltingly talked about this, I noticed that he was slumped down and looked defeated and sad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was something I hadn&rsquo;t considered. &nbsp; I had assumed that, like with programming, once we all understood the problem, the solutions would become obvious. &nbsp; I thought that shedding light on and airing the conflicts and issues would somehow blow off the stink. &nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t understood that office politics work differently. &nbsp;I noticed, as I sat across from Hugo, a hotness on my face and a smallness in my own body, a weight on my shoulders and a tension on my brow. &nbsp;It was at this moment that I realized that I had fucked up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shortly thereafter I was reassigned to a new, much smaller project.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By this point lunch was prepared and we all sat down to enjoy it. &nbsp; Dan continued his line of questioning: &nbsp; &ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I got that you were a nerd who was incompetent with office politics. &nbsp;But you never answered about how you met Mary. &nbsp;What kind of magic put the two of you together? &nbsp; Did your fairy godmother send her to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, not exactly my fairy godmother,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but maybe something along those lines.

&nbsp;What was its graphic design? &nbsp;Were they targeting students or wealthy residents of the Annex? &nbsp;</span><span>I was trying to show that in university </span><sup><a href="#cmnt62" id="cmnt_ref62">[bj]</a></sup><span class="c1">I had learned to think analytically and critically about everything - not to take anything at face value. &nbsp;Justine and Mary were slightly baffled at my fact-free disquisition on Chinese restaurant marketing but smiled and played along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Justine was curious about my time in the States. &nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it terrible, she wondered, to have to be in the US so long? &nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it awful to be away from Canada, where the people were so much kinder? &nbsp;Weren&rsquo;t the Americans so much more biased than Canadians?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Now, it happened that at some level I agreed with some of Justine&rsquo;s biases. &nbsp;I did find American prejudices a bit hard to take at times. &nbsp;But Justine&rsquo;s own level of ignorant prejudice was too tempting a target for me to skip.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt63" id="cmnt_ref63">[bk]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;I started into a rapturous paean to American spirit, to their can-do attitude, and I punctured Justine&rsquo;s preconceptions with pleasure and elan, smiling as I teased her about her attitudes. &nbsp; Justine looked a little mortified, and I barely noticed how Mary was laughing gaily at her friend&rsquo;s discomfiture. &nbsp; We headed home feeling like we&rsquo;d had a fun evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day I screwed up my courage and phoned Christine and asked her out again. &nbsp; She thanked me and let me know that she wasn&rsquo;t available for the next while but maybe there would be a time when she wasn&rsquo;t so busy. &nbsp; I was dismayed but vowed to call her again in a few weeks. &nbsp;These things take time, after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Then the following day, I received a phone call. &nbsp;It was Mary on the other end of the line. &nbsp; I was stunned, tongue-tied. &nbsp;I stammered hello. &nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;d never had a woman call me out of the blue. &nbsp;After some very long, painful moments of awkward, desultory conversation (it would seem that Mary was not particularly glib in these matters, either), she came out with it: &nbsp;She had enjoyed herself the other night and wondered if I would see her again.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt64" id="cmnt_ref64">[bl]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>You mean, just with you?

&nbsp;Eventually I decided, what the hell. &nbsp;I guess I could go out and see what happened. &nbsp;It couldn&rsquo;t be any worse than my current situation. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t like I had a long line of women beating at my door asking for dates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So after a long pause, and some &ldquo;Erms&hellip;.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Umms&hellip;.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Um&hellip; sure, I guess so. &nbsp;What do you have in mind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>She had in mind a movie - perhaps something a little meaningful, romantic. &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Agnes of God</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was playing, and would I enjoy seeing it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We met to see the movie, and ninety minutes of spooky religious stories featuring dead babies and off kilter nuns and debatable miracles spooled by, leaving us stunned and baffled. &nbsp; But after some minutes of plodding along in awkward, dispirited silence towards home, we started to voice our opinions on the movie. &nbsp; There was an edge to some of Mary&rsquo;s comments, wry, thoughtful, and funny observations on the plot and the themes. &nbsp; I responded with my own</span><span>&nbsp;take </span><sup><a href="#cmnt66" id="cmnt_ref66">[bn]</a></sup><span class="c1">on it &hellip; We enjoyed this funny conversation about this terrible first date movie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We continued to meet up, to see movies and play and to go to concerts. &nbsp;And to wittily analyze them afterwards. &nbsp; It transpired that Mary was studying music education, after completing a music degree at University of Toronto.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not much later, Mary&rsquo;s sorority (or as they preferred, women&rsquo;s fraternity) held a toga party, in conjunction with a neighboring fraternity. &nbsp;Would I like to come?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wasn&rsquo;t too keen on university parties, but this sounded different from anything I&rsquo;d been to. &nbsp;It had a kind of sexy edge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the day of the party I arrived at the sorority house. &nbsp; It was full of students, female and male, coursing through the building, yelling over the loud music, drinking beer, and leering at each other. &nbsp; I met Mary, who was wearing a clumsy toga pinned over a T-shirt and shorts and together we headed over to the male fraternity house. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There the action was even louder and more crowded and more beer sodden. &nbsp; &nbsp;The smells of beer and sweaty students permeated the air. &nbsp; The floor was sticky. &nbsp; We each had a drink. Then I had another. &nbsp;I lost track of Mary&rsquo;s count, and also of mine&hellip;. &nbsp; There was noise. &nbsp;There were introductions to people whom I would never meet again. &nbsp;There was not a lot of actual sexiness in the toga costumes, just people wearing bedsheets over clothing and squeezed close together and yelling at each other. &nbsp;There was squeezing through crowds of people to get drinks or pick up winter clothing. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>After a time we headed back to Mary&rsquo;s sorority house. &nbsp;We met more people, including Justine, who it turned out was a sorority sister of Mary&rsquo;s. &nbsp; (I later learned that Justine was Mary&rsquo;s student mentor at her sorority, or as they called it, &ldquo;sister-mother&rdquo;. &nbsp;That meant that my mother&rsquo;s god-daughter - Justine - was Mary&rsquo;s sister-mother, so in the following years we would tell people that Mary was my mother&rsquo;s god-daughter&#39;s sister-daughter, which generally baffled them.)</span><sup><a href="#cmnt67" id="cmnt_ref67">[bo]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary invited me to see her bedroom, which was shared with a roommate, who was out at the party. &nbsp;She closed the door. &nbsp;Would I like to lie on the bed with her? &nbsp;Did I want to kiss her? Did I want help with loosening my shirt?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Next thing I knew,</span><sup><a href="#cmnt68" id="cmnt_ref68">[bp]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I was naked on top of her, also nake</span><sup><a href="#cmnt69" id="cmnt_ref69">[bq]</a></sup><span>d, attempting intercourse in a half darkened room, the noises of the party seeming distant. &nbsp; I could </span><span class="c24">dimly </span><span class="c1">feel the warmth of her body underneath me, her breasts squeezing into my chest, the compression of fitting into a narrow bed causing pressure as my groin encountered her hips. &nbsp;It was a surprising development, but exciting. &nbsp;While the spirit was willing to go ahead with this intention, with all the alcohol and the unexpected movement to bed, there was panic inside. &nbsp;How would this all work out? &nbsp; The flesh was having a difficult time supporting the objective, despite the pleasant warmth of the skin-on-skin contact. &nbsp;I fumbled, trying to raise some interest from my recalcitrant member, attempting to penetrate the dark interior of Mary&rsquo;s secret cavern. Eventually, after some considerable effort to get my member to come out to play, I managed a slight, sloppy ingress.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this moment the door suddenly burst open and light and noise from the party rushed into the room. &nbsp;A tall, dark-haired young woman in a toga swept in, peered into the gloom, and emitted a startled, &ldquo;Oh &hellip; who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary calmly and politely gestured from below me, &ldquo;Hi Jane, this is Bobby. &nbsp;Bobby, this is my roommate, Jane.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jane took in the situation, a naked man lying atop her naked </span><span>roommate </span><sup><a href="#cmnt70" id="cmnt_ref70">[br]</a></sup><span class="c1">during a raucous fraternity party, &nbsp;closed her gaping mouth, and said &nbsp;&ldquo;Hi! &nbsp;..&hellip; I mean, oops, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; &nbsp;Putting her hands to her flaming cheeks, she rapidly turned on her heel and fled, slamming the door behind her. &nbsp;My half filled member fell out of its newly won position and I slumped against Mary, my face aflame with embarrassment. &nbsp;I was mortified, wondering how I could have chosen to take advantage of poor Mary in such a crude and inappropriate way, embarrassing her in front of her roommate. &nbsp;I closed my eyes, trying to work out what to do next, how to extricate myself gracefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop&rdquo;, said Mary.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The toga party led to a new era in Bobby Lindo&rsquo;s life. &nbsp;I was assuredly no longer a virgin. &nbsp; And by dint of this act of sexual congress, and by the fact that Mary and I kept seeing each other, I was, implicitly, In A Relationship. &nbsp; I eventually figured out that the Tafelmusik concert with Justine had been a setup - Justine had pegged me as a fit for Mary, and had told Mary but had chosen not to tell me. &nbsp;I guess she assumed I had some kind of social awareness and therefore would guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary and I didn&rsquo;t talk a lot about The Relationship, nor that much about each other &hellip;. We did tell each other a very little about our sexual histories (I worked out that I wasn&rsquo;t Mary&rsquo;s first, nor probably even her second, but I was too shy to delve further), but we were much more interested in each other&rsquo;s opinions on things: &nbsp; on music and drama and film and novels, in particular.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We started attending Tafelmusik regularly, in time becoming long term subscribers. &nbsp;We tried a few other early music groups, including the Toronto Consort, a group specializing in Medieval and Renaissance music. &nbsp;We went to the occasional opera. &nbsp;We went to Stratford to see Shakespearian plays. &nbsp;We visited trendy restaurants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>For Christmas I bought Mary several cookbooks, including The Complete Asian Cookbook, which had hundreds of recipes from over a dozen countries. &nbsp; That book turned out to be a revelation: &nbsp; From that book we discovered several things, including that we loved Southeast Asian cuisine, and that we loved working together to cook it. &nbsp; We cooked dozens of meals with food from all over the area: &nbsp;Szechuan China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, and others. &nbsp;</span><span>We dreamed of visiting the area.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt71" id="cmnt_ref71">[bs]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At Christmas time we would go to a timeshare resort in the Laurentians and cook Indian food and set off the smoke detectors and fuck. &nbsp;When we talked of the future, it would be about what films to see next, and whether to go to Stratford next summer.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The summer of 1988 we went to Stratford again. &nbsp;The productions we saw that year were not as memorable as previous years. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>In previous years there had been a fun Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead that was produced alongside a Hamlet, so you could see the same story from both points of view with the same actors and costumes on the same visit, and an amazing production of Pericles that made a mediocre play seem quite inspiring. &nbsp;That year all that was memorable was a production of Taming of the Shrew set in a funky 1950s Italy.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt72" id="cmnt_ref72">[bt]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>But something more memorable did happen &hellip; at the Church restaurant, which was, as one might expect from the name, a restaurant in a renovated church, after dinner and a corked bottle of wine, I pulled out a cheap costume jewelry ring and awkwardly proposed to Mary, telling her I would buy her a proper engagement ring once she told me what she wanted. &nbsp; She accepted my proposal </span><span>immediately</span><sup><a href="#cmnt73" id="cmnt_ref73">[bu]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The decision to propose had been a challenging one. &nbsp;I noticed that I didn&rsquo;t really love Mary, at least not in the sense of butterflies in the stomach and the feeling of sweetness and light when I was around her. &nbsp; But I liked her and loved our friendship, our easy companionship and wordplay and shared love of culture and cooking. &nbsp; And I didn&rsquo;t trust love, or at least what I understood of love, and that I didn&rsquo;t trust that love would last through a marriage. &nbsp;Friendship and compatibility, I thought, was a better bet for a long term relationship, than risky and volatile romantic love, which likely would not last.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I felt that if we didn&#39;t marry, Mary would simply move along and find someone who would marry her. &nbsp;And I would be left alone. &nbsp;And after my two year dry spell at Harvard, I didn&rsquo;t fancy my chances for finding another partner. &nbsp; I assumed that I would be alone forever. &nbsp;I felt that I really had little choice but to marry her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>It&rsquo;s interesting as I look back to note that I never discussed most of this with Mary. &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t ask her what she wanted. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t tell her about my fears. &nbsp; In short, I didn&rsquo;t really connect. &nbsp;I projected what she must feel, and acted on my projections and assumptions. &nbsp; </span><span>This was to turn into a pattern.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt74" id="cmnt_ref74">[bv]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once we got engaged, things moved pretty quickly. &nbsp;We moved in together within a few weeks &hellip; My roommate Annette had decided to move back home to New Brunswick, and I took over her lease and Mary moved in with me. &nbsp;And around the same time we both made career shifts. &nbsp;Then in November we were married, in a small ceremony in Toronto followed by a reception in a boutique hotel downtown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For our honeymoon, we waited until the next summer, when Mary would be able to get time off from teaching, and took a five week trip to Asia - Thailand, Bali, Hong Kong, and parts of Japan. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The trip was the trip of a lifetime - we found that the cultures of the places we visited were incredibly different from one another, more different than European countries were from each other. &nbsp;We loved the architecture and the people watching, and especially the food. &nbsp;In Thailand we took cooking classes at the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, and visited the best Thai restaurants in town. &nbsp; We learned about the northern style and the southern style of Thai architecture. &nbsp;We were scammed by a lovely, highly educated &ldquo;tour guide&rdquo; and we loved it. &nbsp;In Bali we learned about Balinese New Year&rsquo;s celebrations, which come five times a year. &nbsp; In Japan we visited a mountain resort that reminded us of Jasper, Alberta. &nbsp;Every day brought something new and amazing.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt75" id="cmnt_ref75">[bw]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>Mary shifted over to teaching high school students, first as a long term occasional teaching business and computer, then as a music teacher in northern Scarborough. &nbsp;We settled into married life. &nbsp; In a couple of years, around 1990 or 1991, the house two doors down went on the market, and we bought it, staying in the same row of 1888 Victorian townhouses, but getting a corner lot with a little yard. &nbsp;We continued to live on the ground floor and in the basement, and we rented out the top two floors. &nbsp; I assumed we would continue to build our marriage, one commitment at a time.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt76" id="cmnt_ref76">[bx]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>Shortly after moving into the new home, </span><span>Mary spoke to me one night at bedtime, with this proposal:</span><sup><a href="#cmnt77" id="cmnt_ref77">[by]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp; Now that we had our marriage and our home, which were fixing up, and she had the job she wanted, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to have a family? &nbsp; We could have kids, and in time take over the whole house to have to raise them. &nbsp;She would be able to have kids who could love her, and she could love them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the face of it, this was a totally reasonable suggestion. &nbsp;We had stable income, a home, and we were building a life together &hellip; and while we hadn&rsquo;t discussed this in so many words when we were married, I think we both assumed we would have a couple of kids, just like our parents had, and so many people we knew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, however, something unexpected happened: &nbsp; Contrary to my expectation, when Mary asked about having kids, I had an immediate and visceral reaction: &nbsp;No way! &nbsp; I had all kinds of reasons that this wasn&rsquo;t the time: &nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t ready, it was too early, I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d be a good father, any kid of mine would probably be a pain in the ass to raise, given my own history, we might want to do other things first, etc., etc. &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary reluctantly accepted my arguments, but I felt guilty. &nbsp;Shouldn&rsquo;t I want to have children? &nbsp;Was there something wrong with me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>An argument that I didn&rsquo;t fully make - I raised but withdrew - was that I was suspicious of Mary&rsquo;s motives for having children. &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t have a problem with having children so that we could raise a new generation of people to carry life forward. &nbsp;But to have children in order to have someone to love us? &nbsp;Well, it seemed to me that there was no guarantee that the children would feel that way, and I didn&rsquo;t want to raise kids with the expectation that they needed to do that. &nbsp;Something felt wrong about that, something a bit needy. &nbsp; Having kids and hoping that they would be there for us in our old age, no problem with that. &nbsp;But creating new lives in order to have someone to love us - that was a step too far for my taste.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt78" id="cmnt_ref78">[bz]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And while the other direction, loving one&rsquo;s kids, was certainly a laudable goal of parenthood, I saw raising children as a huge responsibility, and that it wasn&rsquo;t clear that doing it in order to have someone to love was enough: &nbsp; more like it should be the other way around, that you need to love your kids to have the determination to raise them. &nbsp;Because I expected that raising children would be a challenge, and not necessarily enjoyable all the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t like either of these arguments very much. &nbsp;It felt like I was trying to belittle Mary&rsquo;s desire to have kids by coming up with spurious counter-arguments of my own. &nbsp;It felt that I was being selfish, while she was the one with more compassion and caring. &nbsp;And that my concerns about her motives were a bit shameful, not to be spoken aloud. &nbsp;But in any event we agreed to defer the decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I carried this guilt and shame around for a couple of years, as we both navigated career transitions and went through the business of life: planting a garden, traveling, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c9">[ chapter break?]</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally something changed: &nbsp;In the fall of 1994 I was given an exciting job opportunity in New York City, and Mary would not be able to work there for a couple years until she could get her papers. &nbsp; I suggested that she could use the opportunity to compose music, which was something she had been talking about for years. &nbsp; But she didn&rsquo;t seem at all enthusiastic. &nbsp; Trying to figure out a carrot to get Mary to be excited about the new opportunity, I thought about the idea of having children. &nbsp;Could I imagine myself as a dad? &nbsp;Could it work out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The stars seemed aligned: &nbsp;I would be making a great income, Mary wouldn&rsquo;t be working, and we would be in a new place where we could spend time making a family. &nbsp;We could come back in a few years and settle back into Toronto. &nbsp; So there were lots of great, logical reasons for having kids. &nbsp; Could I swallow my misgivings?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Eventually, I decided I could. &nbsp;I suggested to Mary that this might be a good time to have kids, and she was delighted with the idea. &nbsp; And I found myself feeling excited - about the new job in NYC, about moving, and for the prospect of being a father. &nbsp; So many things changing, all at once!</span><sup><a href="#cmnt79" id="cmnt_ref79">[ca]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary quickly went off birth control, and we settled into a new routine: &nbsp;She had just started a new teaching contract in Scarborough, and would not be able to move to NYC until next summer. &nbsp;So each week or two I would hop on a plane on a Sunday evening and head to Manhattan. &nbsp;I would work there for a week and then come back to Toronto Friday afternoon. &nbsp;Sometimes, instead, Mary would come to visit me in New York for the weekend, as we apartment hunted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first day after work in the new job, which was in a building next to the Chrysler building and across from Grand Central on Lexington, I headed south on Lex just to see what I could see. &nbsp; New York City was interesting, and this was largely away from the most touristy areas. &nbsp; As I headed south of 23rd St., the character of the area changed - there was a mixture of brownstones and &nbsp;several storey apartment buildings of varied height, all looking urbane in a kind of timeworn way, and a beautiful tiny square enclosed by an iron fence, Gramercy Park, which I later learned was locked and only for the neighbours. &nbsp;But the area was beautiful, and I was hooked &hellip; particularly when I headed down Irving Place, the extension of Lexington, and stopped for dinner at Pete&rsquo;s Tavern, a pub with a literary history. &nbsp; I tucked into a strip loin steak and decided that I wanted to leave nearby. &nbsp;I hadn&rsquo;t expected anything so cozy in NYC.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our new routine was exciting but stressful, and eventually we slowed the pace of our visits back and forth a little, sometimes taking a weekend apart to avoid the crush of Laguardia airport and the cab or limo rides to and from the airport.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>At Christmas time, Mary came to Manhattan for a longer stretch, to stay with me at my temporary apartment and get to know our new home city a little better. &nbsp; We went to the Gramercy Tavern, a high end restaurant with a multi-course tasting menu, ending with a beautiful, elaborate cheese course. &nbsp; &nbsp;That night, in the middle of the night, Mary was up vomiting: &nbsp; The beautiful food was too rich. &nbsp; </span><sup><a href="#cmnt80" id="cmnt_ref80">[cb]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the vomiting persisted the next day, and she confessed: &nbsp;She&rsquo;d missed her period, and this was perhaps actually morning sickness. &nbsp;She was pregnant! &nbsp;She went back home with a new life growing in her, both of us excited to see what would happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>While she was there, we had found our first permanent home in New York, a second storey apartment overlooking Eas</span><span>t 23rd Street, a f</span><span>ew blocks from Gramercy Park itself, and on the edge of the Gramercy Park area of NYC. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t quite as nice a location as Gramercy itself, but it was cheek by jowl, and good enough for me. &nbsp;</span><span>We&rsquo;d also considered Brooklyn Heights (too expensive and too far from work) and Park Slope (lovely but way too far on the F train).</span><sup><a href="#cmnt81" id="cmnt_ref81">[cc]</a></sup><span>&nbsp; We started making plans to move t</span><span class="c18 c9">o 23rd St.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At spring break, Mary was back in Manhattan&hellip; when one evening things felt off for her, and then she began to cramp &hellip; then to bleed. &nbsp;Eventually she passed a large lump of organic matter, looking rather like a fetus. &nbsp;The bleeding didn&rsquo;t stop. &nbsp;I began to worry as the colour drained from her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We headed to the Emergency department at St. Luke&rsquo;s Roosevelt Hospital &hellip; they monitored the bleeding for some more hours, then eventually in the middle of the night decided on an emergency D&amp;C, Mary having lost several &nbsp;liters of blood. &nbsp; In the morning we headed home, shaken. &nbsp; The pregnancy was over, the baby was dead, and Mary was pale and weakened and shell-shocked by this turn of events.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Mary&rsquo;s resulting anemia, there was no immediate possibility of trying again to get pregnant. &nbsp;She finished out the school year, then I came back to Toronto to finalize Mary&rsquo;s move down to New York.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That summer, the summer of 1995, I worried for the first time about our marriage. &nbsp;Mary was depressed and lethargic, with little will to take on anything new. &nbsp; There was no spark. &nbsp;Our connection seemed limited. &nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t talk with each other about the miscarriage, or how we felt about it. &nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t talk about the future. &nbsp;I wondered where we would go next, how we would make this work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary took iron supplements to rebuild her blood, and gradually her body returned to health. &nbsp;By the early fall the doctor gave her the reluctant go ahead to try again for a baby. &nbsp;Her mood shifted, and within weeks she was pregnant again. &nbsp; This time things progressed better, and by Christmas time we were talking about cribs and Peg Perego perambulators and infant car seats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a time when drinking during pregnancy had just been deemed catastrophically dangerous, and signs were up everywhere saying that pregnant women should not drink. &nbsp;Our best medical advice was that a very small amount of drinking (say an occasional half a glass in an evening) wasn&rsquo;t particularly dangerous, but Mary found that alcohol didn&rsquo;t agree with her during her pregnancy, so she stopped. &nbsp;But one day around the seventh or eighth month of her pregnancy, we headed to a swanky little restaurant on Irving Place called Verbena, and Mary decided that having half a glass of wine this one time would be quite fine, after the long abstinence. &nbsp; So she ordered a small glass of red, and took a tentative sip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Well, after the long time off alcohol, I guess Mary was surprised by the bite of the wine, because she immediately choked and coughed loudly and spat a large mouthful of red wine all over her white woolen sweater dress, which was stretched over her rotund belly. &nbsp; The entire clientele of the restaurant immediately looked over at this apparently drunken pregnant woman, entirely shameless in drinking so late in her pregnancy, and</span><span>&nbsp;dribbling it down</span><sup><a href="#cmnt82" id="cmnt_ref82">[cd]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;the front of her dress. &nbsp; It was an i</span><span>nteresting experience</span><sup><a href="#cmnt83" id="cmnt_ref83">[ce]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;to have everyone in a place look down their noses in shock and disgust at us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In late May of 1996, I checked in with Mary from work before heading home. &nbsp;She suggested that I pick up some champagne on the way home, because the baby was liable to come soon. &nbsp; I happily strolled homewards &nbsp;and stopped off at a wine store, and considered various fizzy wines for a happy while, eventually deciding on a nice California sparkler. &nbsp; I slowly wandered home, toting a couple of bottles of bubbly, and looking forward to a nice relaxing evening after a busy week.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I arrived at the apartment, Mary was standing at the door, overnight bag in hand. &nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to go!&rdquo; she said. &nbsp; I was surprised. &nbsp; Go where, I wondered?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that she was in contractions and they were five minutes apart and it was really time to get going to the hospital for delivery. &nbsp;Yikes! &nbsp;So we headed up to Yonkers, where Mary&rsquo;s ObGyn had a practice at a snazzy clinic and where we had decided to have the baby. &nbsp; The Friday evening traffic was heavy, and the contractions were coming every few minutes, and I was stressed about the time it was taking. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But despite the congestion we made it up in good time, and soon Mary was ensconced in the delivery room. &nbsp;Things went well, until they didn&rsquo;t: &nbsp;the baby came quickly down the birth canal, hit a sharp turn, and got stuck. &nbsp; And stayed stuck, like a large ship turned sideways in the Suez Canal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>And stayed that way for quite some time&hellip; the beeping of the pulse oximeter showed that the </span><span>pressure </span><sup><a href="#cmnt84" id="cmnt_ref84">[cf]</a></sup><span class="c1">was taking a toll, that the baby was starting to have oxygen deprivation as the umbilical cord got squeezed in the narrow passageway. &nbsp;The machines beeped warnings ominously and insistently. &nbsp;The doc started talking about a C-section, to protect the baby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The delivery nurse, an old hand, eventually suggested, &ldquo;Maybe we could try fundal pressure?&rdquo; &nbsp; This elaborate-sounding technique turned out to be rather simple: &nbsp;The nurse propped herself up on Mary&rsquo;s bed, leaned over her belly, and, in sync with the contractions, pushed as hard as she could on the top of Mary&rsquo;s swollen belly. &nbsp; &ldquo;One-two-three &hellip; heave!&rdquo; she went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two or three contractions later, and the baby finally moved: &nbsp; She quickly slid out of the birth canal, and emerged, pink, into the air: &nbsp;For her first sound, she laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stared at this apparition: &nbsp;This tiny, pink and beautiful infant. &nbsp; I was confused. &nbsp;From all I knew of the birth process, and in particular of this birth, babies were supposed to come out beet red crying, and ugly, covered with blood, dismayed at the treatment they had just received, and to howl in pain and indignation. &nbsp; Was fatherhood already distorting my reality field? &nbsp;Did I somehow get a pair of rose-coloured glasses that disguised the true nature of this invader? &nbsp;It was true that her head was squashed asymmetrically, giving her the appearance of Gumby, but otherwise she had absolutely beautiful features and had a little bit of lovely hair, and a fetching pink smile. &nbsp;A mega cute, pink Gumby. &nbsp;Apparently the fatherhood hormones had already kicked in, and the reality-distorting fields were on full!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or maybe not, because suddenly all of the delivery room personnel were commenting on how unusual that this was - a laughing, pink, beautiful newborn. &nbsp;It felt that we were off to a good start, after a dangerous-seeming delivery.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mother and child repaired to the recovery room and mother had a mug of Guinness to celebrate, and to rebuild her enzymes. &nbsp; We commented that for the rest of her life, Guinness would taste like mother&rsquo;s milk to Juliet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>As Juliet grew, we talked of nothing but her. &nbsp;No detail was too small. &nbsp;How was she sleeping? &nbsp;How was she eating? &nbsp;When had she last pooed, and what did it look like? &nbsp;As her digestive system started functioning, we noticed that her poos were runny and smelled different from an adult&rsquo;s - something fermented and cheesy and a bit rotten. &nbsp; We even were blessed on occasion with the </span><span>lauded </span><sup><a href="#cmnt85" id="cmnt_ref85">[cg]</a></sup><span>&ldquo;projectile poo&rdquo;: &nbsp; a yellow, runny stream of detritus that would emerge under pressure from Juliet&rsquo;s backside during a diaper change, to travel in an arc across the room until it met an immovable object, such as mom or dad&rsquo;s </span><span>abdomen</span><sup><a href="#cmnt86" id="cmnt_ref86">[ch]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We got good at identifying Juliet&rsquo;s diaper state with our noses. &nbsp; One day while strolling home with Juliet in her Italian wheels (her Peg Perego pram), we noticed the characteristic smell coming from the vicinity of Juliet. &nbsp; So we hightailed it home and pulled off her diaper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing. &nbsp; What was going on? &nbsp; We searched about. &nbsp;Nothing on the blankets, no leakages. &nbsp;Finally we followed our noses back to the pram, and noticed the stinky cheese smell growing. &nbsp;Aha! &nbsp; We reached in and pulled out &hellip;. The package of &eacute;poisses cheese, a stinky &nbsp;French soft cheese fermented in Marc de Bourgogne (a kind of Burgundian eau-de-vie), was emanating its characteristic rotten milk fug. &nbsp;We had tucked it in next to Juliet, and in the warmth it had contributed its unique aroma to the carriage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In 1996 we moved from our rented apartment on East 23rd Street to a coop apartment just off University Place on East 9th Street in the NYU area of Greenwich Village, just north of Washington Square park. &nbsp; &nbsp;When Juliet was teething and couldn&rsquo;t sleep, I&rsquo;d tak</span><sup><a href="#cmnt87" id="cmnt_ref87">[ci]</a></sup><span class="c1">e her out in her stroller and head down towards TriBeCa&hellip; the cobblestone streets and sidewalks would jostle and jounce the stroller vigorously, soon putting her to sleep. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">East 9th</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was good to us. &nbsp;We had a one bedroom apartment converted into a 2, with a huge butcher block counter surrounding the kitchen and dominating the living room and dining room. &nbsp;We were just over a wonderful steakhouse and a tasty barbecue restaurant, and steps from a corner store, dry cleaner, and a variety of Italian restaurants. &nbsp;A short distance further put us at all kinds of services - restaurants of all kinds, the lovely SoHo area with its kitchen stores and vintage furniture stores, and so on. &nbsp;Juliet had a toddler friend who lived downstairs, and Mary found a group of women to do African drumming with. &nbsp;Soon we had visiting West African drummers coming by, and djembe drums and goat skin hides stored in our closets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Within a couple of years Mary was jonesing for another child. &nbsp;Life was pretty good in Manhattan, but stressful - my work kept me busy many hours a day, and Mary had help from a mother&rsquo;s helper to take care of Juliet and the business of life. &nbsp; Mary wanted more, and soon she had it - she was ballooning with another child, ballooning to the point of concerns about her health.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Mary was with child, we were looking for a country place to buy outside of New York City. &nbsp;We put in offers on a few places in the Poconos, eventually closing on a property south of the Ashokan reservoir, about twenty five minutes from Woodstock, and just over two hours from New York City.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brad was born around the winter solstice, a few days before Christmas of 1998. &nbsp; We trundled him off to the Harvard Club for a stylish Christmas dinner with his sister and grandparents. &nbsp; Next day he started coughing and sniffling &hellip; within a few days he had taken a turn for the worse, and one evening a few days before New Year&rsquo;s we rushed him to Emergency at St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital nearby, his lips blue, fighting for breath. &nbsp; The staff there seemed disinterested in our panic, demanding that we fill out a form and wait our turn. &nbsp;But the magic words &ldquo;blue lips&rdquo; on the intake form got their attention, and Brad was instantly rushed into the ER itself and under an oxygen mask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brad spent the next three weeks there, in a special isolation ward on the pediatric wing, attached to heart monitors and respiratory apparatus. &nbsp; He fought for breath, gasping with effort, for close to two weeks &hellip; the doctors admired his energy and seemed sanguine about his prospects, reassuring his terrified parents that all would be well, that it would just take time. &nbsp;Apparently he&rsquo;d picked up a case of RSV, probably from us &hellip; RSV, we learned, is a respiratory virus that affects newborns, especially preemies, much more strongly than adults; in an adult it presents as the common cold. And we&rsquo;d had the sniffles before Brad was born.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">New Year&rsquo;s Eve Mary and I sat vigil over Brad&rsquo;s bed in the pediatric ward at the hospital, his grandparents looking after Juliet. &nbsp; As the evening wore on towards midnight, the hospital, normally active with &ldquo;code blue&rdquo; and &ldquo;code white&rdquo; announcements, gradually fell silent. &nbsp;There was an eerie silence for the thirty minutes before midnight. &nbsp; At midnight there was a very quiet cheer from the nursing staff in the distance, then nothing&hellip; &nbsp;then at 12:05 am, there was an announcement on the PA system, a code called to prepare for an incoming ambulance. &nbsp;Then another at 12:07. &nbsp;Then more. &nbsp; By 12:10 it was busier than we&#39;d ever heard it before. &nbsp;By 12:15 or 12:20 it was mayhem, with code blues and code whites and code reds and stats echoing through the halls, and the sound of running feet and rattling beds and gurneys passing the door of Brad&rsquo;s room every few seconds. &nbsp;The sudden surge in activity was shocking. &nbsp;We wondered if there had been a terrorist act, or a major disaster on the subway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually a nurse stopped by to check in on Brad. &nbsp; &ldquo;What was the disaster?&rdquo;, we asked. &nbsp; &nbsp; The nurse looked confused. &nbsp;What were we talking about? &nbsp; We described the extreme activity in the hospital, after the pronounced lull.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; the nurse said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Right, I guess that&rsquo;s confusing. &nbsp; It happens every year. &nbsp;For the few minutes before midnight, everybody is holding their breath waiting for the countdown. &nbsp;The minute it hits midnight, drunk people start to head to their next destination. &nbsp; There are accidents. &nbsp;Fights break out. &nbsp;We get busy.&rdquo; &nbsp;She shrugged, &nbsp;&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d better get going and make up some beds. There are probably going to be a few kids to look after later tonight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Lunch was winding down and people were starting to talk about going back to the</span><span>&nbsp;hot tub.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt88" id="cmnt_ref88">[cj]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monica commented on my story. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo;

I made a deal with my brother-in-law, Pete, a small land developer, to help me set up a small software consulting firm to advise small businesses on software installations. &nbsp; I started to work at this, with little success. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Pete asked me to help take a look at his balance sheet and cash flow to see if I could make any suggestions on how to run his business a bit tighter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Digging into the numbers, I was stunned. &nbsp; Pete&rsquo;s assets were dwarfed by his liabilities, and he had negative cash flow on essentially all of his properties. &nbsp;His only hope was to somehow make a killing by developing some of his properties, but the banks wouldn&rsquo;t lend him money to do this, because they sensed his poor financial condition. &nbsp; I told Pete that he was losing money on everything he did, but making it up on volume. &nbsp;Somehow the joke wasn&rsquo;t very funny.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I quickly decided that I needed to find a more stable income. &nbsp;So I reached out to a head hunter and got myself a job working for Canadian Nuclear Power Ltd. </span><span>&nbsp;(CNPL) t</span><sup><a href="#cmnt92" id="cmnt_ref92">[cn]</a></sup><span class="c1">o help them craft their response to regulators, who after the recent Chernobyl disaster were questioning CNPL about their safety systems. &nbsp;My experience in safety critical train dispatching software at NP was helpful, as was my Harvard writing background.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I worked at </span><span class="c9">CNPL </span><span>for several years, first working with engineers to draft responses to regulators, then actually designing a new generation of shutdown software. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt93" id="cmnt_ref93">[co]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;(My design was made to make its behaviour very easy to review, by putting all of the parameters into easily readable tables, and simplifying the code into a few simple loops to go through the parameter tables. &nbsp; This design, influenced by the work I had done at NP, was deemed insufficiently &ldquo;provable&rdquo; by Ontario Power management, the clients for the work. &nbsp;Basically, there was nothing to prove. &nbsp;So instead, under the influence of a professor of computer science, &nbsp;a much more complex design with thousands of lines of code and tens of thousands of lines of proof was chosen. &nbsp; I was disgusted, believing that a proof that complex was more likely to be in error than my very simple design.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span>After a few years, I managed to get myself fired (or, rather, my contract not renewed) by sending promotional materials about my work at CNPL to senior CNPL managers. &nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what I was hoping to achieve by this, but I managed to piss a few people off. &nbsp;Once again my judgment on office politics was suspect.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt94" id="cmnt_ref94">[cp]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>After CNPL, I worked from home on my own software project for a while, an office automation tool that combined elements of a spreadsheet and database and word processor. &nbsp;

After a year or so I started looking for a new job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By late summer of 1994, I was interviewing for work in the financial industry with Imperial Canadian Bank, a Toronto-based bank. &nbsp;The work was to be either in Toronto or New York. &nbsp; After a screening interview in Toronto they flew me down to NYC on a hot early September day, to be subjected to an intense round of interviews, around 10 in total in one day. &nbsp;Some of the interviews were with traders; they would wander in, say hi, ask about how my day was going, nod vaguely at my answers, &nbsp;and wander off after a minute or so, looking bored. &nbsp; It seemed unpromising, &nbsp;but shortly thereafter, a letter came: they wanted me to report for work in New York in a few weeks, at a starting salary plus bonus about triple my current compensation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Late October of 1994 I flew down to New York City one Monday morning, to report to work. &nbsp;By 9 am when I arrived at the office I&rsquo;d been up for nearly 5 hours and had spent much of that in transit. &nbsp;The scene that greeted me was surprising: &nbsp;a large, nearly empty </span><span>trading floor,</span><sup><a href="#cmnt97" id="cmnt_ref97">[cs]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;with a handful of employees, traders and technical people, gathered around a Sun workstation. &nbsp;They were talking about Bermudan swaptions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I assumed that this was some kind of hazing ritual in which they invented gobbledegook to confuse the new guy, but, no, they assured me, this was a real thing: &nbsp; If, they explained, an American option could be exercised on any day from the day it was struck until it expired and a European option could only be exercised on the final day, its expiration, then a Bermudan option was halfway in-between, just like Bermuda was between America and Europe: &nbsp;It could only be exercised on specific dates. &nbsp;And a swaption was short for a swap option, or an option on a swap. &nbsp;And a Bermudan swaption was a common way of allowing a firm entering a swap to get out of it on any given payment date.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt98" id="cmnt_ref98">[ct]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>This little lesson about derivatives finance was the first of many I learned that year, as </span><span>I rolled up my sleeves and went to work </span><sup><a href="#cmnt99" id="cmnt_ref99">[cu]</a></sup><span class="c1">preparing for the new trading business that was being set up. &nbsp; Planned to start the spring of the next year, it would require hiring dozens of traders and support staff and getting them up and running, all within the next few months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I started an intense stretch of work. &nbsp;I would arrive in the office around 8 am and leave around 8 pm, then on weekends head home to Toronto. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt100" id="cmnt_ref100">[cv]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp; I barely saw my apartment. &nbsp; One day I got a letter from my landlord accusing me of loitering half-clad in my apartment window while drinking (apparently) alcoholic beverages. &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed bleakly and wrote back that it hadn&rsquo;t been me - that the only thing I ever did in my apartment was sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the time pressure there wasn&rsquo;t enough time to do things carefully and right. &nbsp;Instead, we had to hack existing systems to get them to do what we needed, and to hack together crappy new systems to fill the gaps in between. &nbsp; We were starting with nothing and didn&rsquo;t have the time nor resources to make good systems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I excelled at figuring out the least complicated and crudest way to solve business problems. &nbsp;I put together an explanatory delta profit and loss calculation system in about a week using Microsoft Access&hellip;

In 1997 the &ldquo;Asian contagion&rdquo; roiled the markets, as foreign exchange rates fluctuated, and markets were volatile. &nbsp;ICB had written many long-dated options on Asian markets, and hedged them with short dated options&hellip;. As the markets seesawed, ICB found itself losing on both sides of the market, with the hedges going the wrong way, and hedging often creating additional losses. &nbsp; Some days our unit lost $50mm.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt105" id="cmnt_ref105">[da]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>With the volatility and losses, the organization roiled. &nbsp;Some people left, and people were shuffled into new jobs. &nbsp;I was asked to move from Technology to Trading and take over the structured products &ldquo;Quant&rdquo; desk, which was tasked with developing financial models for the most complex products. &nbsp;Two of its main outputs were a backward induction lattice pricing model, and a calibrated Monte Carlo pricing model designed to support early exercise options. &nbsp;Such as Bermuda swaptions. &nbsp; My job was to translate between the math-talking Russian PhDs and the traders.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt106" id="cmnt_ref106">[db]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Being a quant was fun. &nbsp;I learned that when a quant told me that a model was too complicated to explain, it usually meant that he was hiding something, some weakness or limitation. &nbsp;I became good at sniffing those out and explaining to the traders how to evaluate the quant work. &nbsp;And good at getting the quants to focus on making their models work for real problems, rather than continuing to polish them for theoretical beauty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>During this time I developed a small formula parser for representing financial product payouts to be evaluated using pricing models. &nbsp;And a small XML-based language for describing the products. &nbsp;These proved to be </span><span class="c9">helpful </span><span>in the ensuing few years.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt107" id="cmnt_ref107">[dc]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>ICB&rsquo;s losses spurred by the Asian contagion continued, and other problems surfaced. &nbsp;</span><span class="c9">We </span><span>couldn&rsquo;t make money in the vanilla swap flow business. &nbsp;Some of the exotic products had unexpected losses during hedging. &nbsp;Volatile commodity markets were tricky to navigate. &nbsp; The losses continued.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt108" id="cmnt_ref108">[dd]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually in 1999 ICB decided to downsize its New York operation, and they asked me to transfer back to Toronto, giving me a few months to decide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I had assumed that I would be in NYC for only a few years, maybe three, and it had already been five. &nbsp;So coming back to Toronto would have made sense. &nbsp;But Mary and I had come to enjoy New York, and we had just bought a country home in the Poconos. &nbsp;So we decided that I should look around and see if there were any opportunities that could keep me in New York a little longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I interviewed for a few positions, including a few </span><span>dot-com firms that were starting up in &ldquo;Silicon Alley&rdquo;, as the nascent tech sector in New York was called. &nbsp; I was offered a position in a firm that paid a mediocre salary but offered a lot of stock options. &nbsp; I did the math and decided that I&rsquo;d be better off getting a wad of lottery tickets. &nbsp; So I ended up taking a job at the big and prestigious Wall Street investment bank, </span><span>Cabot Lodge &amp; Company</span><span>, to guide a financial industry messaging standard called FML that they&rsquo;d just announced but had no one to lead. &nbsp;My experience with XML product representations proved instrumental.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt109" id="cmnt_ref109">[de]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>Working at CabotLodge was a big change. &nbsp;Instead of being part of a small, scrappy team with a huge mandate, I was surrounded by scores of technologists all working on one aspect of derivatives trading - mostly on the exotics business. &nbsp; What at ICB would have been supported by a couple of quants and a spreadsheet add-in technologist, at CabotLodge was supported by a team of dozens of Smalltalk programmers in each of New York and London, along with a whole quant department. &nbsp;I heard that CabotLodge spent over a billion dollars a year on interest rate derivatives technology alone, way more than ICB Markets&rsquo; entire trading, middle office, and technology budget across 5 asset classes and six trading locations.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt110" id="cmnt_ref110">[df]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also learned about CabotLodge&rsquo;s focus on connection and reputation. &nbsp; &ldquo;Reputational risk&rdquo; was a huge part of the employee training programming: &nbsp;basically avoiding anything that would get CabotLodge sued or in the headlines for ethical lapses. &nbsp; &nbsp;I gradually got the idea that there actually were a lot of things CL did that could potentially go that way. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CabotLodge also had a huge squad of &ldquo;rainmakers&rdquo; - investment banking Managing Directors with ill-defined responsibilities, who seemed to spend most of their time golfing with investors and visiting government regulators, and who somehow apparently pulled in millions of dollars a year in compensation for doing that. &nbsp; A couple of them were assigned to help me with my new task, which was to convince the other big investment banks on Wall Street to join the FML effort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We began an intense round of presentations, and more importantly, power lunches in the snazzy executive dining room on the top floor of CabotLodge&rsquo;s &nbsp;69 Wall St. headquarters. &nbsp; We gradually persuaded first one firm, then another, to join us if the other firms did. &nbsp; Eventually after some months of effort, we had all of the big firms on the street signed on - except for Goldman Sachs, which was convinced that this was all a big plot by CL, and that GS could do a messaging standard better than the rest of the street.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Within a year or so we had the first version of the FML standard developed, agreed, and released, and implementations started to use it. &nbsp; My managers at CabotLodge were delighted. &nbsp;They were convinced that with my technology and organizational skills, I was the next great manager to take on their next high profile technology project.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the heels of the success with FML, CabotLodge promoted me to be in charge of TradeWiz, their planned new single-dealer web-based electronic trading platform. &nbsp; This was the peak of the dot-com bubble, and firms were throwing money into the internet like they were trying to feed a roaring bonfire. &nbsp; Amazon and Google were starting to take off, and imitators were trying to find the next big thing: &nbsp;WebVan and Pets.com among others burned through billions, not to mention Enron.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was working with an internal trading manager named Antonio Monsanto, a big, self-confident Italian who decided that we needed to go big or go home. &nbsp; He wanted to spend millions to establish market position. &nbsp;He wanted an all-singing, all-dancing system with real-time quote display, click to trade, and automated online price negotiation. &nbsp; As one of our project managers called it, &ldquo;The Space Shuttle&rdquo;. &nbsp;He was willing to take the time it needed to build all of this before releasing - what turned out to be a year or more, from early 2000 until late 2001. &nbsp;Antonio would stand at the white board sketching out his ideas, stopping from time to time to take a deep, restorative sniff of the dry-erase markers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was skeptical. &nbsp;My experience with the Internet by then was that no one had any idea what would fly. &nbsp;And that the most successful entrants were the ones that released stuff quickly and often, changing it based on customer feedback.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I proposed that instead of building the space shuttle, we start with a little three month project, to display near real-time streaming prices on a continuously updating web page, with a &ldquo;click to trade&rdquo; button that would display a trader&rsquo;s phone number to call when a customer wanted to trade. &nbsp;I figured that this would get us a product out to market quickly, let us start to engage with clients, and would be a cheap and cool-looking way to advertise our products. &nbsp;Then over the coming year or two we could gradually add new functionality as client demand told us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Antonio dug his heels in, and took it up to my boss. &nbsp; Jim Ashton was a young guy in charge of a huge, billion dollar a year technology organization. &nbsp;He looked about seventeen, with a buzz cut and ears that stuck out as much as mine, but was actually only a few years younger than me, in his early thirties. &nbsp;Jim Ashton heard my argument, and Antonio&rsquo;s, and told me to go big, and do it Antonio&rsquo;s way. &nbsp; I had enormous misgivings but I went ahead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We hired a huge high tech team from a market data vendor to start designing and building a fully custom solution based on real time messaging. And then when we realized that that would take two years to build, we hired another, smaller team to build a tactical solution using an Java application server, a technology that was just developing at the time. &nbsp;At one point we had around 50 people in my teams working on TradeWiz.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our &ldquo;tactical&rdquo; solution cost quite some millions and took nearly a year to build and deploy. &nbsp;The &ldquo;Space Shuttle&rdquo; solution based on real-time messaging - well, that tanked, and never delivered anything. &nbsp; A year later, after a huge amount of stress and conflict, we had a nearly working &nbsp;tactical solution, and we&rsquo;d spent $50 million getting there. &nbsp;I fought battle after battle to keep costs under control, only to regularly be overruled by Antonio and Jim. &nbsp; On weekends I would go to my country place in the Poconos and work on my water garden, working for hours on digging out dirt and installing retaining walls. &nbsp;The physical effort, banging a pick into the ground to loosen the rocks, and shoveling away the dirt, was my main stress outlet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>With all the conflicts and delays (mostly caused by Antonio&rsquo;s grandiose and changing requirements, and our inability to rope him in), Antontio lost trust in me, and eventually in late August 2001 he got Jim to demote me and replace me with his best bud, a technologist from London who had mastered the art of toadying, unlike me. &nbsp;Given the conflict, I wasn&rsquo;t altogether surprised, though I was highly disappointed and angered.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt111" id="cmnt_ref111">[dg]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>TradeWiz was eventually fully launched. &nbsp; By the end of its first full year of operation it had successfully executed several dozen client trades, each worth maybe up to a hundred dollars in revenue. &nbsp;The revenue generated by the system in the year wasn&rsquo;t enough to pay for a month of its datacenter rental, much less to justify the millions spent developing it. &nbsp;It turned out that most TradeWiz users preferred to look at the real-time streaming prices and call their trader, </span><span>essentially as I originally proposed.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt112" id="cmnt_ref112">[dh]</a></sup><span>&nbsp; </span><span>It was shut down a couple of years later, after I had left CabotLodge. &nbsp; When I heard that I felt a well-justified </span><span>schadenfreude</span><sup><a href="#cmnt113" id="cmnt_ref113">[di]</a></sup><span>.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt114" id="cmnt_ref114">[dj]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c3 c22" id="h.rxypgydkw9oy"><span class="c13"></span></h1><h1 class="c17" id="h.m0ui52801quz"><span class="c13">Chapter 11: Trips</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>We came back in from the hot tub and lolled about in the farmhouse living room in front of the fire.

&nbsp;After a few minutes of this uncertainty, I started to notice a feeling of safety, that all was good with the world. &nbsp;And that I was so lucky to be with Cassandra. &nbsp;And how wonderful she was, how sexy and beautiful and caring. &nbsp; And how much I wanted to smoosh against her. &nbsp;And how our clothing was in the way of that, how I wanted to run my hands over her flawless skin, her dancer&rsquo;s body, her breasts, her waist, her hips..</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Cassandra was going through a similar </span><span>process</span><sup><a href="#cmnt122" id="cmnt_ref122">[dr]</a></sup><span class="c1">, and in a moment our clothing was off and we adhered to each other, our skin connected from head to toe. &nbsp;We started telling each other of our love as we slid over each other. &nbsp;

We spent a lot of time together. &nbsp;We grew closer. &nbsp;We planned a trip to Europe together, to meet Cassandra&rsquo;s family and to visit the Venice Biennale.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before our trip to Europe, we took another trip: &nbsp;A mushroom trip. &nbsp; We did this one at Cassandra&rsquo;s, connecting on her improvised couch in her large kitchen. &nbsp; &nbsp;This one was different from the MDMA trip. &nbsp; I had been told to expect visual hallucinations, and what they might look like: &nbsp;Things vibrating in my vision, distant things looking closer than close things. &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, I did have those types of hallucinations, but only a very few of them, and only for a brief moment. &nbsp;Instead, I had a different kind of effect: &nbsp; I lay next to Cassandra, with my eyes closed and my hand on her pussy. &nbsp; And it felt to me that my whole being was at my fingertip, as it gently caressed her clitoris. &nbsp;Everything in the universe revolved around that point, where my fingertip met the nub at the top of her pussy. &nbsp; And even with my eyes closed I could see how we connected, and feel myself at her portal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a time, not fully satisfied with the effect, I took another dose. &nbsp;Then Cassandra had a scary dream: &nbsp;She saw us becoming older together, then after a decade, my leaving her for a younger woman. &nbsp;She was terrified. &nbsp; In my high, I was just amazed that she imagined that we might be together for a decade, and didn&rsquo;t fully understand how upset she was. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t really understand at that point her deep terror of abandonment, a deeply buried feeling within her that the psilocybin released.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Eventually she came down from the trip before me. &nbsp;As I lolled about in a silly bliss, she started banging around pots in the kitchen, making something to eat. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt123" id="cmnt_ref123">[ds]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp; It was her birthday, and I was too stoned to properly appreciate her and wish her a happy birthday, and Cassandra was disappointed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The scary premonition of my departure was extraordinarily painful for Cassandra, and overshadowed any enjoyment she had from the trip. She resolved not to do mushrooms again, nor any other hallucinogen, because she&rsquo;d also had a terrifying acid trip with her previous partner.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c18 c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Shrugging off the </span><span>scary mushroom trip, </span><span class="c1">we continued to do MDMA trips together from time to time to cement our love. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d smoosh our bodies together, and I&rsquo;d spend hours going down on Cassandra, a sex act that still worked on the drug. &nbsp;(Intercourse was out because the drug prevents erections, and blow jobs were out because it makes you unconsciously clench your jaws, not a good thing when you have a cock in your mouth.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In 2016 we opened up our relationship and Cassandra began seeing Taylor, her yoga teacher. &nbsp;The two women went for long walks on the beach and snuggled, but the relationship didn&rsquo;t quickly progress to the highly carnal, and Cassandra assured me that I had nothing to worry about.. &nbsp;Then one day it did blossom, and then exploded in a spray of desire and emotion. &nbsp;Cassandra breathlessly told me how they&rsquo;d spent the night together, not sleeping because they were too busy fucking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly Cassandra was spending nearly every weekend and many weekdays with Taylor, and the waves of feeling crashed over me: &nbsp;a torrent of panic, followed by a swirling whirlpool of grief, then a rocky cascade of anger. Eventually it settled to a fast moving current of enthusiasm, with occasional whitecaps. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As this current of emotion gushed through my life, I unexpectedly found myself dating Brittany, whom I met at a meetup for polyamorous people. &nbsp;Her lifetime of unsatisfactory relationship experiences caused her to be cautious, reluctant to jump into bed. &nbsp;After a handful of dates, at the end of an an hours-long, uncomfortable conversation, sitting on opposite ends of my sofa and lobbing verbal salvos across the yawning gap between us, suddenly she crawled over to me, straddled my lap, opened my pants, pulled down her jeans, and sat on my cock. &nbsp;The resulting two or three minutes of intercourse were relatively underwhelming but a relief. &nbsp;It felt like I was finally getting somewhere with polyamory, with this slightly odd relationship..</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cassandra&rsquo;s reaction to this turn of events was somewhat surprising to me: devastated and volcanic. &nbsp;What was I thinking? &nbsp;How could I do that to her? &nbsp;She told me that what I was doing with Brittany was much different than what she had with Taylor, because she was dating someone of the same sex, while I was dating someone of the opposite sex. I feebly countered that she was spending weekends away with her girlfriend, and having multiple dates during the week, while my relationship with Brittany seemed much more limping and limited - a desultory weekly date with little contact in between. &nbsp;And I told her that it didn&rsquo;t feel a lot different to me that her lover had the same plumbing as she did - she was still away from me, basking in the new relationship energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We eventually worked our way through some of our feelings,and began talking about how to navigate these two relationships. &nbsp;And in particular whether we would reserve Ecstasy for each other, or also share in that with lovers. &nbsp;We decided that we would only do it when both of us were present - but if a lover would join us, that would be fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taylor was a massage therapist, and I hired her regularly to give me massages. &nbsp;She would come to my apartment and move around me as I lay on the floor, covered in a towel, and give me therapeutic and Thai massages. &nbsp;It felt lovely and grounding and nurturing and connective as she slid her hands over and applied pressure to my body and even sometimes sat on my back or butt as she worked on my shoulders and back.. &nbsp;Taylor had a warm and caring energy, but it only went so far: it was clear that there was a limit on how warm and open she would be with me. &nbsp;I assumed that this was partly because I was a man, and partly because I was her lover&rsquo;s lover, and she wasn&rsquo;t too keen on that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>At one of our appointments, I mentioned that Cassandra and I were planning an MDMA trip, and suggested, feeling rather nervous, that it would be fun for Taylor to join us. &nbsp; &nbsp; Given her limited warmth towards me, I didn&rsquo;t expect her to be open to it, but to my surprise she almost instantly said yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cassandra was also surprised and delighted at this development. &nbsp;We wondered what the trip would be like. &nbsp;Given Taylor&#39;s preference for women, would it be as sexy and sensual as our previous trips? Excitement thrummed for the days before our get together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the afternoon of the trip, Taylor showed up at my place (a new apartment, across town from my old loft) with her supplies: &nbsp;A water bottle. &nbsp;A mouth guard. to protect against jaw clenching. &nbsp;(Clearly Taylor was experienced with this.) &nbsp; And to my surprise, a quantity of lube - MDMA is dehydrating, and lube can be important to maintain wetness during trips, should genital touch be desired. &nbsp;Clearly, I gathered, Taylor was anticipating some kind of a sexy time. &nbsp;I filed this fact away for later, with some excitement and uncertainty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cassandra was already there, and together we ate a tiny snack as we prepared for the trip. &nbsp;Butterflies were cavorting in our bellies, and the mouthfuls of food pressed down on them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>As we ate, we talked vaguely of wanting to connect, but not what that meant. &nbsp;Was sensual or sexual activity planned or desired? &nbsp;If so, what did we want or not want to do? &nbsp; It seemed that none of us wanted to go there - we wanted the trip to answer those questions for us. &nbsp;We thrilled at the scary unknown, but Taylor&rsquo;s lube hinted at what might come to pass.. I was curious to find out where things would go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>It was Christmas time, and before the trip started I gave Taylor my Christmas present to her: &nbsp;A bottle of Bowmore scotch. &nbsp;I had discovered that we had a shared appreciation for this smoky Islay single malt. &nbsp; She was delighted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After we took our doses of E and drank water, we lounged in front of the fireplace in my living room. &nbsp; The small fire crackled, and we thrummed with anticipation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>After some time, perhaps twenty minutes, the thrill had ebbed away, replaced first by calm and peacefulness, then with a smidgen of boredom. &nbsp;The crushed lepidoptera stew in our bellies had settled down. &nbsp; &nbsp;We started to wonder</span><span>&nbsp;whether our dose was a dud, as nothing exciting appeared to be happening. </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;To pass the time we watched the party light that Taylor had brought as it sent multi-coloured flickers of light orbiting over the ceiling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After some further, indeterminate time, we started feeling relaxed, more playful, less cautious. &nbsp; Cassandra, the most daring, &nbsp;loosened her blouse, and then removed it with a suggestive smile at us. &nbsp;Then she fiddled with her belt, soon tossing it at me, unzipped her cargo pants, and slid them lasciviously over her hips and down her legs, with a loud, contented sigh. &nbsp;She lounged, limbs akimbo, displaying her gorgeous, lingerie-clad figure. &nbsp;Then with a playful glance at Taylor, she loosened her bra strap and slid her undergarment off her torso..</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noticing that I was a little behind in the program, &nbsp;I unbuttoned my shirt, then removed it, eyeing Taylor as I did so. She continued to lounge in front of the fire, with a contented smile, by all appearances relaxed. &nbsp;After a few minutes, her loosely tied top also came off, then her soft bra, revealing her alabaster breasts. &nbsp;Her left nipple had a stud through it,and her right had none. &nbsp;Cassandra and Taylor explained the story of her single stud, a rather painful and intimate tale involving nipple asymmetry and nerve damage. &nbsp;I felt initiated into some of Taylor&rsquo;s secrets. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our bodies grew closer. &nbsp;Hands slid briefly over bodies - my hand on Cassandra&rsquo;s thigh, Taylor&rsquo;s hand brushing Cassandra&rsquo;s side. &nbsp; I could smell the scent of essential oils and herbs - sandalwood and jasmine - that Taylor rubbed on her skin. The back of my hand brushing Taylor&rsquo;s ankle&hellip;. Cassandra kissing us both in turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually Cassandra&rsquo;s panties were off, displaying her deftly trimmed shock of dark pubic hair, and she was encouraging me and Taylor to remove our underwear. &nbsp; With a glance at Taylor, I shyly slid off my shorts. &nbsp;She smiled playfully, with a slight toss of her head. &nbsp;Then Cassandra turned to Taylor, lying next to us in her panties: &nbsp;&ldquo;Your turn,&rdquo; she commanded. &nbsp; And she turned to me: &ldquo;You help her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taylor raised her eyebrows momentarily, then leaned back on her elbows and lifted up her bottom, gazing at me. I reached over and grabbed her panties at her sides, by her pelvic bones, and quickly pulled them over her ass and down her legs. &nbsp; As Taylor moved her legs to allow the panties to come all the way off each leg in turn, they separated, revealing the space between them. &nbsp;I stared longingly at her pussy, which sported a short, blonde bush, trimmed to reveal her lips. &nbsp;It looked delicious, and I had a huge urge to press my mouth into it and lick it with my tongue. &nbsp;Then I tore my glance away, still feeling unsure how far this would go. &nbsp;Taylor seemed pleased and relaxed, but I still wasn&rsquo;t sure I was invited to engage with her in that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, in this slight pause, Taylor said, &ldquo;Hey, there&rsquo;s something a girlfriend showed me how to do with Scotch. &nbsp;Are you interested in hearing about it?&rdquo; &nbsp; So of course we got the bottle of Bowmore&rsquo;s out and opened it. &nbsp; And Taylor instructed me to take a small sip, and hold it in my mouth. &nbsp; Even with the MDMA my mouth tingled. &nbsp; And then she told me to go down on Cassandra without swallowing, keeping alcohol tingling on my tongue. &nbsp; &nbsp;Cassandra obediently opened her legs for my mouth. &nbsp; I approached her familiar pussy, with the prominent bush and the smooth, clean lips below. &nbsp; I licked her from back to front then ran my zinging tongue over her clitoris, enjoying the familiar taste. &nbsp;She moaned and squealed at the intense buzz emanating from her lady parts. &nbsp;I grabbed her around her narrow waist and licked her more deeply, then paused for a recharge of Bowmore&rsquo;s, and began again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then after a some more moments of this delectable torture, Cassandra shook me off and said, &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s Taylor&rsquo;s turn!&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;I assumed that she meant it was Taylor&rsquo;s turn to go down on her, but then I saw what she meant: her look in my eyes and her nod clearly meant she wanted me to give Taylor some scotch-imbued oral attention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I looked at Taylor, wondering if she would go along with this, but after a moment&rsquo;s consideration she said &ldquo;Ok, sure,&rdquo; with a smile, and then she was lying back on her elbows with her legs spread, telling me that she was looking forward to feeling the Bowmore&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I went down on her for the first of many times that evening. &nbsp;Under the influence of the MDMA, and under the eyes of Cassandra, my partner and hers, and with a flavor enhancer of Bowmore&rsquo;s, she tasted amazing: smoky, salty, tangy, maybe slightly herbal, with an electric zing from the alcohol. &nbsp;I began a long, slow exploration of her pussy with my mouth and tongue. &nbsp;I gently spread her outer lips slightly apart and ran my tongue up the ridge of her inner lips, then to her clit, flicking up against it. &nbsp;Taylor sighed quietly with pleasure. My hands cradled her ass, enjoying the warmth of her soft, white skin. &nbsp; I gradually worked deeper into her vulva, my tongue slowly exploring between her inner lips, the wetness spreading. &nbsp;Cassandra looked on, humming delightedly at her two lovers getting along so famously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Cassandra was not a huge fan of receiving cunnilingus, but apparently Taylor was. &nbsp; &nbsp;She murmured appreciatively at the sensations she was feeling. &nbsp;Helped by the MDMA, I I was flying, in sensual bliss, and in love with both her and Cassandra. &nbsp;I recharged with Bowmore&rsquo;s once or twice, then just continued to pleasure her without pause for assistance from the booze.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; I was connected to Taylor&rsquo;s heart and soul through my tongue and her vagina.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a long stretch of long and loud, contented sighs, during a short pause, Taylor remarked to Cassandra, &ldquo;Your man has a talented tongue!&rdquo; &nbsp; Cassandra smiled an acknowledgment &nbsp;and encouraged us to continue, telling us how much she enjoyed seeing us together. &nbsp; I resumed my prolonged exploration of Taylor&rsquo;s labia and clitoris with my mouth, after a time adding in a finger or two to enhance the experience. &nbsp;Cassandra fondled my ass and watched closely with enjoyment as I contentedly explored Taylor&rsquo;s vulva.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taylor&rsquo;s comment pleased me mightily, as gay women were not generally known to be appreciative of straight men&rsquo;s skills at pleasing women, and Taylor had been critical of me in the past. &nbsp;It seemed that my sexual prowess must be top notch to please her this way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the evening wore on, I found myself spending more time with Taylor than with Cassandra. &nbsp;I found Cassandra pushing me away and seeming to cleave closer to Taylor, or to prefer to be by herself. &nbsp; And I found myself strongly drawn to Taylor. &nbsp;She had a warm, nurturing manner that Cassandra seemed to love and that I adored. &nbsp; I started fearing that Taylor had something to give Cassandra I could never provide, not being a woman. &nbsp; I found myself believing that I needed to connect with Taylor if I wanted to keep Cassandra in my life - that I could lose Cassandra to her girlfriend if I wasn&rsquo;t careful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At some point, perhaps overstimulated by some gentle touch by Taylor, Cassandra pulled herself away with a gasp. &nbsp;After a few moments off to the side, she throbbed with wave after wave of orgasm, something that was surprising, because normally on MDMA it&rsquo;s hard to get enough focus to be able to orgasm. &nbsp; And no one was touching her. &nbsp;Overstimulated, she kept crying to us, &ldquo;Stop! Don&rsquo;t touch me! &nbsp;Leave me alone!&rdquo; &nbsp; Taylor and I looked at each other with a smile. &nbsp;After many minutes of convulsions, she gradually turned inward and rested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taylor and I continued to connect &hellip; I ran my hands over her luscious body and tasted her beautiful pussy again, my hand on her breast&hellip;Eventually I paused. &nbsp;We drank water to slow down the effect of the MDMA. &nbsp;We talked about Cassandra. &nbsp;We drank more water and sipped whiskey and hugged and snuggled and chatted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, after an hour or two, Cassandra woke up, complaining woozily about needing to pee. &nbsp;Taylor and I took her arms and walked her unsteadily to the bathroom and sat her on the toilet. &nbsp; Nothing. &nbsp;(As the MDMA slowly wears off there&rsquo;s a point where you need to pee out all the water you&rsquo;ve been drinking and retaining, but can&rsquo;t quite do it.) &nbsp;Cassandra wailed in frustration and discomfort. &nbsp; Taylor comforted her like you would a child. &nbsp; Eventually, after some minutes and much comforting, there was the quiet tinkle of a hesitant stream of urine in the toilet. &nbsp; Taylor and I cheered and clapped our hands. &nbsp; When she was done, we walked Cassandra back to lie down on the comfy blanket in the living room, and then sat on the sofa, loosely embracing and talking..</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After another few minutes, Taylor said that she had to pee, also. &nbsp;I had a sudden, enormous desire to follow her and watch her pee, too &hellip; but despite the hours of performing oral sex on her, it seemed that this might be a step too far, just a bit too intimate with my girlfriend&rsquo;s girlfriend. &nbsp; So I waited in the living room and forlornly watched her head down the hall to the bathroom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few minutes passed by with no sounds of water, then Taylor called, &ldquo;How is Cassandra doing? &nbsp;How are you doing?&rdquo; &nbsp; I called back that Cassandra was still resting, and that I was ok. &nbsp;The questions continued. I found myself slowly inching toward the bathroom. &nbsp;Taylor commented, in wonder: &nbsp;&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it cool to see her coming again and again like that? &nbsp; Have you ever seen that?&rdquo; &nbsp; I poked my head around the bathroom door, which Taylor had left ajar. &nbsp;Taylor was sitting on the toilet, obviously still trying to get her pee to flow. &nbsp;She smiled at me, evidently wanting my company for this slow and delicate operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We continued this amicable conversation for a few minutes, Taylor waiting for the pee to come, me standing by the door, watching her sitting, nude and unselfconscious, on the toilet. &nbsp;She looked me in the eye as we talked about Cassandra, whom we both adored. &nbsp;I took in her short blonde hair, her yoga teacher&rsquo;s figure, her shapely breasts, the stud in her left nipple, the tattoo on her arm, her creamy hips nestled on the toilet seat&hellip;. &nbsp;It was a nice moment, relaxed and companionable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually there was a little tinkle from under Taylor&rsquo;s bottom, and I cheered and clapped. &nbsp; Taylor smiled and took a little bow, still sitting on the toilet seat. &nbsp; A warm glow of gratitude washed over me, gratitude that I was trusted in this intimate way by someone who could be seen as a rival, someone not known to be a friend of many men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taylor squirted out a little more pee, wiped herself and stood, then said, &ldquo;Your turn&rdquo;. &nbsp;She brushed past me coming out of the washroom. &nbsp;I trembled a little as she went by.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stood over the toilet bowl a moment, dangling my shriveled cock and trying to squeeze out the pee &nbsp;as Taylor glanced at me from the washroom door. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;I clenched again. &nbsp;Still nothing. &nbsp; &ldquo;Not ready, yet, &rdquo; I said to her. &nbsp;Taylor, clearly much less interested in watching me pee than I was for her, shrugged and said that she was going to go and check on Cassandra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, after a few more trips to the bathroom by each of us, Taylor and I guided Cassandra to bed, lurching all the way, and we fell in bed beside her. &nbsp; Cassandra was on one side of the bed, Taylor in the middle, and I was beside her, feeling pushed away by Cassandra when I tried to get in next to her. &nbsp; Cassandra slept deeply, and eventually Taylor drifted off to sleep. &nbsp; I lay next to her, turned on by all that had happened, my brain a swirl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After several more hours, when I noticed Taylor stirring a little, I couldn&rsquo;t contain my desire for her any longer, and I went down on her again, sliding down the bed, putting my head between her legs and diving in for a long, wet dinner. &nbsp; She moaned sleepily and contentedly. &nbsp;This continued on and off for a very long time, perhaps an hour, perhaps more. &nbsp;Taylor half awake, me between her legs, my mouth slurping on her genitals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sleep finally did come. Late that morning we all woke up, all feeling so beautifully connected, our bodies aglow with happy chemicals, endorphins and oxytocin, among others. &nbsp;We all snuggled. &nbsp;Cassandra had finally returned to awareness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was still horny, and continued to fondle Taylor absently. &nbsp; Cassandra chirped about how nice it was to see the two of us together, vaguely hinting that she&rsquo;d enjoy seeing more. At some point Taylor smiled at me, and reached out and fondled my cock momentarily. &nbsp;I felt a surge of pleasure, and a throb in my groin - less at the actual touch, which was gentle and tentative, than at what felt like act of caring and generosity: I realized that this was the first time she had touched my genitals, or even touched me in any erotic way, this whole trip. &nbsp;&hellip; it seemed a huge step for this supposedly man-hating rival, something kind and nurturing, something challenging to her own values. &nbsp;I was delighted that I had passed this test, that I was worthy of being cared for. &nbsp;Then she said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you make love to Cassandra? &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to see that.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;I realized that I had been holding back from that for fear of upsetting Taylor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My cock back to normal now that the MDMA had mostly worn off, I was pleased to comply. &nbsp;I quickly grew hard and rolled onto Cassandra. &nbsp; Cassandra and I fucked vigorously in the bed next to Taylor, who gently caressed Cassandra and sometimes me as we rocked together. &nbsp;It was heavenly. &nbsp;Cassandra raised her flexible hips toward me as I planked over her, sometimes pressing my chest against her firm, round breasts topped with pointy nipples. &nbsp;I finally came intensely, releasing copious seed after hours of foreplay and build up, and Cassandra climaxed vigorously, too. &nbsp;It felt divine, climaxing in my beautiful partner as her loving girlfriend caressed us both.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterward, we continued to talk, of how we had enjoyed connecting, and of how we might connect in the future. &nbsp; I was in love - not only with Cassandra, but also with Taylor, whom I had come to adore over the night, for her nurturing spirit and her openness towards me, as well as for her sexy body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cassandra suggested that sometime she would enjoy photographing Taylor and me together &hellip; perhaps, she suggested, making love. &nbsp;As she said that last bit, my stomach tightened with a lurch. &nbsp;Somehow, despite the hours of sensual connection and oral sex between Taylor and me, this didn&rsquo;t feel right. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t feel that Taylor wanted a man&rsquo;s cock inside her, or at least not mine, and if she didn&rsquo;t want that, neither did I. &nbsp; &nbsp;Taylor just quietly gasped, then vaguely murmured that she wasn&rsquo;t sure she was ready for that. &nbsp; I found myself irritated with Cassandra for saying that she wanted us to fuck, for not reading the room. &nbsp; But we brushed this awkward comment away and continued connecting.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our lovely 3-way connection lasted another day or two. &nbsp;That evening the three of us went together to a big party at a famous Toronto dance photographer&rsquo;s, and felt deeply happy and connected. &nbsp;We hugged tightly as we parted that evening, feeling bonded and in love.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterwards, I wrote an email of appreciation to Taylor, gratefully and flirtatiously thanking her for the wonderful evening, and for the sexy Bowmore serving suggestion, and saying that I would like to get to know her better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cassandra, copied on my note to Taylor, reacted the next time I saw her in a way I found surprising: &nbsp; She became upset with me, and told me that I shouldn&rsquo;t have written that note: &nbsp;now, she said, Taylor thought that I was trying to sleep with her, and that Taylor didn&rsquo;t want that. &nbsp;And that Taylor hadn&rsquo;t liked how she was treated during the trip, that she had felt pressured and taken advantage of, and now she regretted what had happened. &nbsp;And that I should refrain from reaching out to Taylor. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was difficult for me, because I was head over heels in love with Taylor, and I felt confused and misunderstood. &nbsp;But I adored Cassandra and loved our connection, so reluctantly I complied. &nbsp; &nbsp;I was also upset that I may have unknowingly exceeded Taylor&rsquo;s boundaries. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t reach out to Taylor in this way again, and tried to hide my attraction on our subsequent massage appointments. &nbsp;It was like it never happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That beautiful, connective &nbsp;MDMA trip turned afterwards in my mind into a difficult, conflict-ridden thing, as I started seeing it as a terrible misunderstanding - that I had perhaps exceeded Taylor&rsquo;s limits, that I should have discussed boundaries before going on the trip, that I maybe was guilty of some kind of sexual assault, that Taylor might be ambivalent tease about men, that maybe Cassandra was afraid that I was too attached to Taylor, etc., etc. &nbsp;Feelings and stories about that trip affected events down the road however&hellip;</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_50h7hsgnrx09-1 start"><li class="c30 c7 c33 li-bullet-0"><span class="c9 c18"></span></li></ul><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.d00h4fs27087"><span>Chapter 12: Family </span><span>Challenges</span><sup><a href="#cmnt124" id="cmnt_ref124">[dt]</a></sup></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;OK,&rdquo;

Mary and I loaded him and Juliet and assorted diaper bags and our black cat into our ten year old Honda Civic and headed up to our newly purchased country home in Ulster County, NY, just south of the Ashokan reservoir in the Poconos. &nbsp;We had been there only a couple of times &nbsp;after we had closed the deal in October, because come November it was getting too close to Mary&rsquo;s due date to risk the long trip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We made it to the end of the lane, then got stuck in the snow. &nbsp; &nbsp;We ferried the two children and the luggage the quarter mile up the steep, winding driveway to our home. &nbsp;Brad was swung up the lane in his infant car seat, and Juliet toddled and was carried through the snow. &nbsp;We resolved to buy a four wheel drive.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt125" id="cmnt_ref125">[du]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next couple of years were a blur - my job at ICB disintegrated, I started working for CabotLodge; Mary suffered post-partum depression after Brad&#39;s birth; we grew further apart. &nbsp; During the week I would work 11 hours days, and once every week or two we would have a date night and go to dinner and a show. &nbsp;On weekends we would drive to the Poconos.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things at CabotLodge on the TradeWiz project became more and more fraught. &nbsp;In mid August, 2001, just before I left on vacation, I was told that I was being demoted; I would still have a job, but it would be as an architect on the project, no longer the program manager. &nbsp; I was disappointed, frustrated; I felt betrayed. &nbsp;I cursed Antonio Monsanto and Jim Ashton.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>On that rather grim vacation, Mary, the kids and I headed back up to Ontario by car, to visit friends and family in Toronto. &nbsp; We drove our fairly new four wheel drive SUV, a </span><span class="c9">Honda Passport,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;bought for the steep Poconos laneway. &nbsp; We headed along a small road near Algonquin Park, on our way to meet relatives near Ottawa, Juliet and Brad sleeping comfortably in their car seats in the back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, the road shifted from asphalt to gravel; I had missed the warning sign. &nbsp;I gently eased off the gas to slow down. &nbsp; But before the car had slowed much, the road veered sharply to the left. &nbsp; I pulled the steering wheel hard, and instantly noticed the top-heavy car wobbling and the rear wheels drifting in the gravel; the car lurched and skidded. &nbsp;I turned into the skid, and headed in a diagonal drift along the road&hellip; which then took a sharp turn to the right. &nbsp; I slewed around that corner, fishtailing back and forth, thankful for my experience driving in snow in Montreal. &nbsp;Gradually the fishtails narrowed again as I regained control&hellip; but the road veered again, to the left, less sharply this time&hellip; but enough that the fishtailing passenger rear wheel went a couple of feet off the edge of the road, into the shoulder&hellip; and then promptly off the edge of the narrow shoulder into a three foot ditch. &nbsp;The rest of the car followed over the edge: &nbsp;the whole vehicle slammed on its side into the ground, then rolled over onto its roof.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I saw the ground rushing up at me, and the roof collapsing in, and I knew that I had killed us all. &nbsp; I yelled, &ldquo;Fuck! Fuck! &nbsp;Fuck!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Somehow, the car kept rolling and screeching, and we ended up back upright, rocking on the wheels. &nbsp;The windshield was shattered, the roof was depressed by most of a foot. &nbsp; And I was still cursing that I had killed my family. &nbsp;</span><span>There was someone calling me in the background.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt126" id="cmnt_ref126">[dv]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary&rsquo;s insistent voice finally intruded on me: &nbsp;&ldquo;HEY!!&rdquo; &nbsp;she shouted. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bobby!! &nbsp;Are you ok?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stopped yelling, paused in confusion, and I took stock. &nbsp;Sore neck and disheveled all over, and scratched and slightly bleeding, but everything seemed to be connected still. &nbsp; I moaned, &ldquo;Yes, but I killed the kids.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re ok!&rdquo; Mary called. &nbsp; And I looked around, and sure enough, both kids were both emerging sleepy-eyed from their nap, wondering why there was so much shaking going on. &nbsp;Their car seats had kept them in place, and the roof hadn&rsquo;t come too close to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We managed to clamber out of the broken car and extricate the kids. &nbsp;Mary found a farmhouse to make a call to the emergency services. &nbsp; Because of my sore neck, the paramedics put me on a backboard for a trip to the nearest hospital, telling me that they needed to check for a broken back or neck. &nbsp; After a few minutes, my legs and arms started going numb. &nbsp; </span><span class="c18 c9">I started to wonder if maybe this apparent reprieve was actually going to result in me in a wheelchair for the rest of my life&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Well</span><span>, turns out it was just an inconvenient position on the backboard, and there was nothing wrong with me other than some cuts and bruises and a broken pair of glasses. &nbsp; &nbsp;The car was a writeoff, but we were ever so relieved that we&rsquo;d emerged with only a few minor cuts and scrapes.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt127" id="cmnt_ref127">[dw]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">So </span><span>late August 2001 was </span><span class="c9">a challenging time</span><span>, with a career-derailing demotion and a near fatal car wreck. &nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t get better quickly.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt128" id="cmnt_ref128">[dx]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A week or two later, on Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001, back in New York, &nbsp;I headed to my Wall St. office via the R subway train, passing through the Cortlandt-WTC station around 8:30 or a little after, and emerging a couple of minutes later one stop south at Rector St, as was my usual pattern. &nbsp;I walked across to my office at Water Street to get ready for a 9 am meeting. &nbsp;Heading into the meeting, I noticed people gathered around computer screens, looking at images of the World Trade Center, where, as I understood, someone had accidentally crashed a light plane through a window. &nbsp;&ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; &nbsp;I thought. Annoyed at the distraction, I called everyone into our meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>After some minutes in the meeting, we were called out by colleagues, some kind of safety drill related to the incident. &nbsp;There were rumors about the crash, that there were possibly more planes, that we were possibly at risk. &nbsp;It all seemed ridiculous. But we were evacuated by building security to a windowless utility floor. &nbsp;Before I headed to the emergency evacuation room, I was able to call Mary and let her know I was safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We stayed in that room, unsure of what was going on, for a long time - nearly two hours</span><span class="c9">, I estimate</span><span>. &nbsp;After waiting some minutes we felt a thud and a shaking through the building - it felt like a truck had hit a concrete building support, and had shaken it. &nbsp;It was disturbing. &nbsp; There was no indication of what happened. &nbsp;Then, a while later, there was another similar vibration. &nbsp;There still was no information about what was going on.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt129" id="cmnt_ref129">[dy]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, we were released through the emergency exits, walking down many flights of stairs, and told to go home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The streets were surreal. &nbsp;There was a half inch of white powder, looking like show but apparently plaster or concrete dust, caking the ground, and there was a thick white mist blowing around. &nbsp; A heavy stream of people trudged grimly north up Pearl Street, dead silent. &nbsp; I&rsquo;d never </span><span>seen such calmness in such a large crowd in the city. &nbsp;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt130" id="cmnt_ref130">[dz]</a></sup><span class="c1">People who tried their cell phones just got a busy signal. &nbsp;People trudged northward or across the Brooklyn Bridge in silence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Periodically, I&rsquo;d glance over toward the WTC complex to see what had happened. &nbsp;</span><span class="c9">For some reason</span><span>, I couldn&rsquo;t find the twin towers behind all the billowing clouds and dust. &nbsp; I assumed they would eventually emerge, but </span><span class="c9">for some reason</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t find them. &nbsp;I guessed the clouds were bigger than they looked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After around an hour of silent trudging, close to noon, I made it home to my apartment, to find Mary there. &nbsp; She looked at me in relief, and then said, &ldquo;Did you see them fall?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Puzzled, I asked, &ldquo;Did I see </span><span class="c6">what </span><span class="c1">fall?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>It was at this moment, watching the replay on TV, &nbsp;that I finally discovered what those large thuds were.</span><span>&nbsp; About two hours after the rest of the planet knew</span><sup><a href="#cmnt131" id="cmnt_ref131">[ea]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The next couple of months</span><sup><a href="#cmnt132" id="cmnt_ref132">[eb]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;continued to feel surreal. &nbsp; At work we shifted to an emergency office on Park Ave. in midtown for some weeks. &nbsp;My responsibilities were unclear, and I decided to duck responsibility for sorting out the mess at the office. Coming back to Wall Street some weeks later, each day on the way onto Wall Street we had to pass National Guard troops in full camo gear and toting assault rifles. &nbsp;The air in lower Manhattan reeked of electrical fires for six or eight weeks after the disaster. &nbsp;Subway routes changed for months as tunnels were cleared and stations were dug out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I had missed disaster in several ways. &nbsp; On 9/11, there was a trade show at the Windows on the World, at the top of the WTC. &nbsp; I had spoken about FML at that trade show the year before, and might have been invited back in 2001, but fortunately things had gone a different way. &nbsp; I was, however, scheduled to speak about FML at a meeting at the top of the WTC two days after 9/11. &nbsp; I had a number of colleagues who worked at the top of the WTC. &nbsp;Most made it out, or rather never made it in. &nbsp;A few didn&rsquo;t.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt133" id="cmnt_ref133">[ec]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Life turned into a grim, joyless routine. &nbsp;My job was painful, and the city slowly tried to heal its wounds. &nbsp;CabotLodge had recently merged with National Industrial Bank, and we started talking about job cuts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A year after the demotion and 9/11, the other shoe dropped: &nbsp;I was to be let go as a result of the National merger. &nbsp;I was an underperformer, not needed in my current position. &nbsp; I could apply for another position at CabotLodge, but there was no guarantee.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt134" id="cmnt_ref134">[ed]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>I jumped on the chance for a change</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;I was done with working for a big company, but I wanted to keep working in financial technology and with FML. &nbsp;So I decided to start my own financial technology business specializing in FML. &nbsp;I took the (very small) CabotLodge severance package and hung around for the designated eight weeks, and started planning my new enterprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Part of the plan I had was to rent out our coop apartment in Manhattan and move outto the Poconos full time. &nbsp;Our cost of living would be cut dramatically, but I would be close enough to NYC to take a train into town to have business meetings as needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I talked it through with Mary. &nbsp; She was concerned about what it would mean for the children&rsquo;s schooling, but agreed with me that it made sense to try to make a go of my business, and that if necessary we could be creative about their schooling. </span><span>&nbsp;I&rsquo;d been thinking about the possibility of my own business for a while, and now I finally had the chance to do it.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt135" id="cmnt_ref135">[ee]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I immediately began planning for the move, and started setting up things in the country. &nbsp;We scheduled our move and rented out our apartment on 9th St. in the Village.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Geez,&rdquo;

fortunately the weather was good on the day of the move, because the snow drifts were all plowed in time for the moving vans to unload.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Things progressed in a new rhythm in the Poconos. &nbsp; I worked from my improvised desk in the crowded bedroom. &nbsp;Mary took the kids to school&hellip; then pulled first Juliet, then Brad out of school, because she wanted to give them more attention than she felt the local schools gave them. &nbsp;She was disappointed with how they were being taught, and wanted to give them a leg up, and didn&rsquo;t like how the other kids treated ours.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt137" id="cmnt_ref137">[eg]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We didn&rsquo;t get out a lot, other than for work and school. &nbsp; Occasionally we&rsquo;d go out to a restaurant. &nbsp; Later, we&rsquo;d sometimes meet up with parents of our kids&rsquo; friends for a dinner at a nearby restaurant. &nbsp;(In the Poconos, &ldquo;nearby&rdquo; meant less than a 30 minute drive).</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Mary didn&rsquo;t seem to be doing well</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;in terms of</span><span>&nbsp;health. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d often head to bed to rest when she had a chance. &nbsp; The first year or so we lived in the Poconos, she invited friends to come from Toronto to stay with us for a long weekend. &nbsp;The minute they arrived, she headed to bed, asking me to entertain her friends, and to take care of the family, and she stayed in bed most of the weekend.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt138" id="cmnt_ref138">[eh]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would ask her what was wrong, and what needed to be done. &nbsp; She told me of her digestive troubles: of her celiac disease, and other problems. &nbsp;She told me she was going to the doctor and getting advice on what to do, and had it under control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This pattern persisted, with ebbs and flows, for a couple of years, with Mary&rsquo;s health seeming to be slowly declining. &nbsp; I was working feverishly, starting my business - working long hours preparing sales presentations, and programming, and drafting documentation, and traveling to NYC and London to visit clients. &nbsp;Mary homeschooled the kids, and took them to various enrichment activities around the county, logging several hours a day or driving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Eventually, after yet another moment where Mary had to suddenly withdraw for health reasons, I demanded that she set up an appointment with her family doctor, and asked her if she would allow me to accompany her. &nbsp; So I did, and I told the doctor of all the problems that I&rsquo;d been seeing in Mary&rsquo;s health. &nbsp; I told her that whatever she was doing for Mary, it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt139" id="cmnt_ref139">[ei]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doctor was stunned. &nbsp;Apparently Mary had minimized the symptoms, thinking she could be strong and it would all be ok. &nbsp;So the doc ordered a full round of tests to get to the bottom of things: &nbsp; After blood tests and an MRI and some other tests, there results came back: &nbsp;Mary had Crohn&rsquo;s disease, an autoimmune disease that affected the intestines and bowels, and could cause, among other symptoms, excruciating pain. &nbsp; It seemed that Mary&rsquo;s wan complexion and tiredness came from trying to suppress this agony.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>This diagnosis led to a new</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;shift</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;Mary started new drug treatments, and was examined further. &nbsp; It was determined that surgery would be needed, to trim out a section of her intestine that was too badly damaged to heal. &nbsp;She would need a colostomy bag for months, until, after everything healed, everything could be reattached as originally (minus a length of small intestine).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary had planned to use the summer to build a large patio on the front of the house, helped by the kids. &nbsp;As a treat, she planned to put in a hot tub, thinking that she would enjoy it. &nbsp;But her illness precluded doing that work, and instead I started working on the patio by myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Mary headed to Albany for a few days for the surgery. &nbsp;While she was gone, I rented a backhoe to dig out and level the land in preparation for the patio, and ordered gravel and sand and pavers, and set to work. &nbsp;The work with the backhoe was a little hairy, but I (just barely) avoided knocking the front steps off the house, as Brad watched and cheered. &nbsp; I kept at the leveling and tamping and paver installation for the coming weeks.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt140" id="cmnt_ref140">[ej]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Mary&rsquo;s return from the hospital, she was tired, and the doctors prescribed a program of gentle walks to rebuild her strength. &nbsp; On one of her walks, during the late fall, we walked up the steep lane through the forest to the house. &nbsp;Partway up, she stopped, panting. &nbsp;Panting on this hill wasn&rsquo;t unusual, but this was way harder than I&rsquo;d seen before, and soon turned to gasping. &nbsp;She could barely make it the few meters back to the house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We called the doctor for help, and headed to her office. &nbsp;There, after seeing Mary, the doc set up an emergency CT scan in Kingston NY, twenty minutes away. &nbsp; Mary continued gasping and turned ever greyer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We headed over to the hospital in Kingston and got Mary to the radiology lab. &nbsp; A few minutes later, a resident came out: &nbsp;Mary had had a large pulmonary embolism, a blood clot stuck in the lungs, and they could see on the CT scan that it had blocked a significant amount of her lung capacity. &nbsp;She had been put in an ambulance and was being driven to Albany, a much bigger hospital, for emergency surgery. &nbsp; She would probably survive, but they needed to be quick, and they couldn&rsquo;t make any guarantees. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>I headed out to my car, and rested my head on the steering wheel. Visions of becoming a single parent while in the middle of launching a business came to me. &nbsp; I imagined losing Mary, and trying to take care of the kids. &nbsp; I saw myself failing, overwhelmed, not knowing how to care for the children, alone, missing Mary. Tears flowed. &nbsp;There was a squeezing at my throat.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt141" id="cmnt_ref141">[ek]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After about five minutes of sobbing, I realized that I didn&rsquo;t have time for that. &nbsp;The emotions would need to wait. &nbsp;I needed to get home and check on the kids, whom I&rsquo;d left home alone, under the care of Juliet, who was around 11 at the time, too young to be entrusted with that responsibility for any length of time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I drove home, wiping the tears from my eyes, and told Juliet and Brad that mom needed to go to the hospital in Albany for more tests. &nbsp; I got them to bed, and then sat in the living room in disbelief, my brian swirling but not making any clear connections. &nbsp;Eventually I called my mom in Montreal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s in hospital again, and I&rsquo;m not sure if she&rsquo;s going to make it. &nbsp;And I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mom listened to my news, heard the fear in my voice, asked a few questions, and then rang off, saying that she needed to talk to dad. &nbsp; &nbsp;A few minutes later she called back. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming down to stay for a while to help you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re staying in a motel near Kingston. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t try to argue. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve already made the reservations for a week, and we set out tomorrow morning.&rdquo; &nbsp;I felt like a kid who&rsquo;d made a bad boo-boo at school, and whose parents had showed up to sort things out. &nbsp;Tears of humiliation and relief pricked at my eyes. &nbsp;Suddenly I felt, while still ashamed of my weakness, a little less alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Mom and dad came, and were </span><span class="c9">as good as their word</span><span>. &nbsp;They stayed with the children while I drove up to Albany, a little over an hour each way, and visited with Mary. &nbsp; And while I was gone they tidied then cleaned up our home, which had degenerated into an untidy, dirty mess, </span><span class="c9">due to </span><span class="c1">my focus on my business and Mary&rsquo;s illness. &nbsp;Each night they went back to their motel to give me and the kids some space. &nbsp;Each day they spent hours cleaning up the home, organizing things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the hospital in Albany Mary&rsquo;s health gradually improved, with some ups and downs. &nbsp;The docs did some procedures and administered some meds to open up the airways and stop the clotting, and put in a blood clot preventer to reduce the risk of another clot moving from the legs to the lungs. &nbsp;Her lung function gradually improved, and the prognosis became better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a week or so, my parents came to me with a plan: &nbsp;They would bring Juliet and Brad back to Montreal and take care of them there, while I got on with taking care of Mary and with my business. &nbsp;Mom&rsquo;s background as a primary school teacher would come in handy. &nbsp; And once Mary was back home from the hospital, I could spend some quiet time with her to help her recuperate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>This configuration lasted about three weeks. &nbsp; It turned out that Juliet and mom just couldn&rsquo;t get along. &nbsp;My mom fumed, and Juliet acted out. &nbsp; Mom </span><span class="c9">fumed</span><span class="c1">, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t working out. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to come and get Brad and Juliet and take them home after the holidays.&rdquo; &nbsp; She described the meltdowns that had happened on a shopping expedition for some books for Juliet, and Juliet&rsquo;s recalcitrance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary and I headed to Montreal for the Christmas holidays. &nbsp; There was an icy wall between Mom and Juliet. &nbsp;We brought the kids back home to the Poconos afterward and I prepared to send them back to school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next few months were a blur. &nbsp;Mary spent much of her time in bed, regaining her strength. &nbsp;With the surgeries and health issues, her weight had dropped precipitously, and she began work rebuilding it. &nbsp; First thing in the morning I would drive the kids down to the end of the lane to catch the school bus, then settle into work on my business. &nbsp; Juliet would go first, and sometimes I would have time to go for a quick spin in the new hot tub before getting Brad ready to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once or twice a week I&rsquo;d head to the grocery store to reprovision. &nbsp; It was a new challenge, trying to feed a family with various dietary restrictions, and I would take a while figuring out what we could eat, and where everything was. &nbsp; But it was also one of the few times in the week that I had a moment on my own, a moment to reflect. &nbsp; It became my time to take stock of where things were and how they were going. &nbsp; And as challenging as things were, it was satisfying to know that everyone was getting fed and to school, and that my work was progressing, and that Mary was slowly returning to health.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The kids spent a semester back in school, during the spring of 2008. &nbsp;By the spring, Mary was healthy enough for her surgery to reconnect her colon and get rid of the colostomy bag. Come August, Mary announced that she would be taking the kids back out of school, to home school them. &nbsp; They had struggled in public school, and she had identified that they had various learning difficulties. &nbsp;She said that they needed her individual help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was reluctant for Mary to do this. &nbsp;I felt that Mary barely had the energy to get out of bed, and that homeschooling two vibrant pre-teens would be a huge challenge for her. &nbsp;I doubted that she had the energy for it. &nbsp; I suggested that she could wait to make the decision, wait until she was healthier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary demurred, and filled out the forms to pull the kids out of school again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It turned out that I was wrong: &nbsp;Mary threw herself into homeschooling with a vengeance, taking the kids to programs, leading a home school orchestra, and researching all kinds of learning techniques to help the kids. &nbsp; And she did it: &nbsp;every day she got the kids to all their assigned classes, and delivered the lessons at home that she needed to, and got dinner made.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But by the end of dinner each day, Mary was done. &nbsp;Shortly after dinner she&rsquo;d be yawning, and she&rsquo;d head to bed around 8 or so. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d never have a chance to talk. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d suggest that we get together with friends occasionally, and she&rsquo;d usually demur, citing tiredness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, I complained: &nbsp;I told her that I was working long hours and had no one to talk to. &nbsp;I commented that it seemed that she had turned away from me. &nbsp;I told her I missed our fun discussions about music and novels and plays. &nbsp; I said I wanted that back in my life. &nbsp;That I wanted her to be present for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being needy,&rdquo; Mary told me. &nbsp;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that I&rsquo;m putting all of my energy into teaching the kids? &nbsp;I&rsquo;m still sick and I don&rsquo;t have anything left over for you. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll have to figure it out for yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This rebuff stung. &nbsp; It felt that I&rsquo;d done my damnedest to hold things together at the most difficult imaginable time, and I had done so successfully, and that my reward for doing so was to be abandoned and snubbed. &nbsp;My pride in navigating the choppy waters of the last year was replaced with frustration and disappointment and resentment. &nbsp;I felt alone, more so than I had when I was playing little Dutch boy holding back the dyke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My sense of distance and loneliness simmered. &nbsp;I wondered what to do. &nbsp; Around that time a dating website for cheaters called &ldquo;Ashley Madison&rdquo; started up. &nbsp;Their motto was &ldquo;Life is short. Have an affair.&rdquo; &nbsp; Upset as I was, this made sense to me. &nbsp; I signed up, and started looking for a match. &nbsp;I even found one or two, and sent out a couple of messages, creating elaborate fantasies of what I would do when I met someone. &nbsp;(I imagined having dinner in a restaurant with a date, and demanding, mid-dinner, that she hand over her panties, right at that moment.) &nbsp; But then I noticed that I couldn&rsquo;t do it. &nbsp;It all seemed so difficult and inappropriate and contrary to my values. &nbsp; &nbsp;I let the Ashley Madison account go dormant, and moved on to other things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, I decided that I needed to make myself more attractive to Mary. &nbsp; First, I had to find some activities to do, something to help me feel energized and alive. &nbsp;So I started playing hockey again, for the first time since college. &nbsp;I set up a rink on our pond, and then the next winter in our driveway. &nbsp;I started obsessively practicing shooting wrist shots, then slapshots and snapshots. &nbsp;I even eventually got fairly decent at shooting, though not without giving myself a repetitive strain injury in my right shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Getting out of the house and getting some exercise was good, but it didn&rsquo;t lead to much socialization. &nbsp; I considered doing some art - there were life drawing classes in the area, and I thought about going. &nbsp;But this seemed edgy and difficult. &nbsp;I tried doing a little sketching from photos, and it was heavy going. &nbsp;I procrastinated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">[cat?]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, my business started to prosper. &nbsp;I signed a contract with an industry utility to evaluate setting up a reconciliation utility using my FML-based software. While this was going on, I started working on converting the attic of my garage to a new office, so I could have somewhere outside of the bedroom (and the overcrowded home) to do my work. &nbsp;I added dormers to give more space and wired it for electricity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, around early 2009, the client gave the green light to go ahead to buy the software and set up the utility as a new product offering. &nbsp; All of a sudden my financial situation improved: &nbsp;The contract called for a 5-year buyout, but included lots of upfront and interim payments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After these developments, I realized that if things went well I could potentially move the family back home and take early retirement. &nbsp;While the contract for my business wasn&rsquo;t enough to live on for the rest of my days, it was a good start, and if things went well I could possibly slowly start to wind down my consulting work in a few years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I talked about it with Mary: &nbsp;she was delighted with the idea. &nbsp; We quickly decided to do it - we would renovate our 1888 Victorian semi in Riverdale, which we hadn&rsquo;t sold and had continued to rent out, and we would aim to move back to Toronto in a year. &nbsp;We would put the kids back in school in Toronto, where we trusted the public school system much more than in the Poconos. &nbsp;We aimed to be back in time for the start of the school year in Sept 2010. We&rsquo;d even bring the hot tub with us, putting it on a specially strengthened deck on the third floor. &nbsp; We&rsquo;d finally come full circle, having made a small killing in New York and returned richer and wiser.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt142" id="cmnt_ref142">[el]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.vtiiwaa34e0l"><span>Chapter 13: What is Integrity?</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amber said, &ldquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s all go for a walk while the sun is out. &nbsp;You can tell us about your return to Canada. &nbsp;Wasn&rsquo;t that when things started changing in your life?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Coming back to Toronto was a shift. &nbsp;All of a sudden we were back on the same street as I had lived on for a decade, over fifteen years ago, going to the same stores and restaurants as before, and hanging out with most of the same friends we had had before we left. &nbsp;But now we had kids, and for them it was all new: &nbsp;They were unapologetically Canadian, loving hockey and maple syrup, but their new home was strange to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I threw myself into work: &nbsp;At the same time as I was winding up my 5 year software buyout contract, there was a huge industry-wide push to implement some new government regulations, and I found myself wrapped up in a big, lucrative consulting contract for the next year or two, something that looked like it would tail off rapidly within a couple of years. &nbsp;My dream of retiring early seemed to look more feasible, as I was making money hand over fist, working long hours but on what seemed to be a project with an end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moving up to Toronto was exciting, and getting the newly renovated space set up and decorated was fun, but after some months, with the art mostly framed and hung, it wasn&rsquo;t clear to me what do to. &nbsp;My marriage seemed a bit better than it had been a couple of years back, but there was still a distance between me and Mary: that gap that had opened up, that I had really noticed after her health crisis, never seemed to heal. &nbsp;I was doing a little better, but I was feeling lonely and uncared for, and relatively unwanted in the family unit, except to provide money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I considered my options. &nbsp;What could I do to improve things? &nbsp;How could I make myself happier and more attractive, in a way that Mary would notice and respond to?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started reading Athol Kay&rsquo;s Married Man Sex Life, and working out, and then attending life drawing, and everything started to shift. &nbsp; After a year of this, I was fitter and more attractive and more flirtatious than I&rsquo;d been. &nbsp;I was drawing a few times a week, I had new friends, and I was going to the gym, and I was getting over my heartbreak about Ekaterina. &nbsp; And I noticed that Mary wasn&rsquo;t into me, didn&rsquo;t appreciate me, didn&rsquo;t really have a lot of time for me. &nbsp;And that I was pretty lonely. &nbsp;And at some point, I realized that I wanted to address this, that I was tired of trying to get Mary to notice me, that I&rsquo;d been working for years trying to fix whatever was wrong between us, and it wasn&rsquo;t working.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d even tried communicating with her. &nbsp;I would say to her things like, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m feeling that maybe things with us could be better. &nbsp;I was thinking we could talk about it. &nbsp;How are you feeling about us? &nbsp;Is everything OK?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Mary would say, &ldquo;Oh, I think everything is fine.

To stop waiting for Mary to decide to care about me. &nbsp;To stop trying to be the strong, independent type who would take care of himself, while secretly hoping his spouse would notice, and to just do what I wanted. &nbsp;To take what Mary said at face value, and to proceed with my own plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pondered, again, having an affair. &nbsp;There was a woman in my drawing group with whom I had a vibe: we hugged, she offered neck rubs, I could feel the energy. &nbsp;I helped her out with a few tasks. &nbsp;Then one day when Mary was traveling, I invited Katy over for dinner on my third floor deck, sitting by the hot tub. &nbsp;We chatted as dusk fell. I imagined getting into the hot tub with Katy, nude, and making out with her&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Somehow it didn&rsquo;t feel right. &nbsp;Maybe I was afraid of the consequences? &nbsp;Anyway, Katy eventually made noises about going, and I quickly took her up on her suggestion and drove her </span><span class="c9">home</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;That was the last time we hung out that way. &nbsp; But the thought of transgressing my marriage vows was in the air. &nbsp;First the unrequited lust for Ekaterina, then the frisson of energy with Katy. &nbsp;What would be next?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next wouldn&rsquo;t be far off. A few weeks later, during July 2012, at the weekly free life drawing group that I organized at a local gallery, Anya showed up as an artist: &nbsp; Her friend, Vlad, said that she&rsquo;d enjoy posing sometime in the coming few weeks. &nbsp; Anya was a few years older than me, around 52 or 53, petite, with feminine hips and a blonde pixie cut, and a playful way about her. &nbsp; &nbsp;I got her contact info so I could set up a date for her to pose for us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We set the date, a few weeks off, and I forgot about it. &nbsp;But the date came, and Anya posed. &nbsp;She was playful, energetic, and not afraid to take her clothes off and show off her body. &nbsp;In fact, she reveled in the attention. &nbsp;I noticed that I was attracted to her energy. &nbsp;I noticed that her body looked enjoyable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterwards, I reached out to thank her for posing. I flirted a bit. &nbsp;I told her that she&rsquo;d looked tasty&hellip; &nbsp;This slightly rude compliment seemed to please her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We began a </span><span class="c9">gentle </span><span>flirtation, talking about possibly drawing together, or her posing again. &nbsp;The flirtation </span><span class="c9">gradually &ndash; &nbsp;then</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;quickly &ndash; escalated. &nbsp;We made plans to go to a drawing night together. &nbsp;This time, it was an erotic drawing group she liked to go to, the Keyhole Sessions, that specialized in groups of spectacular women posing together in complicated poses involving rope and floggers and the like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We went together and sat at the same table. Anya&rsquo;s aggressive if not frenetic drawing style caused the table to shake and made it hard for me to ink my drawings, but I enjoyed her expressive and exuberant demeanor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After this date, the email flirtation escalated, turning rapidly into an emotional affair: &nbsp;we teased each other, we made sexy comments, we talked openly of our challenges in our life. &nbsp;We flirted about our attraction to each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One day I upped the ante, emailing Anya that I thought she&rsquo;d be fun to make love to. &nbsp; She quickly rebutted, saying, &ldquo;Why do men have to be so crude, always making things about sex?&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thinking that our whole conversation had been about sex, I pushed back: &nbsp;&ldquo;Men have a name for women like you,&rdquo; I huffed. &ldquo;Tease.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anya did not find this raillery at all enjoyable: &nbsp; She retreated instantly, stopping answering my emails. &nbsp; I panicked&hellip; eventually I got in touch, and realized how hurt she was by my insinuation that she was manipulative, and understood that that was a bottom line for her, and that she would end our correspondence. &nbsp;It was over. &nbsp; I was stunned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I apologized abjectly for my lack of decency, and after hearing my apology, she reluctantly suggested we could go out after the next week&rsquo;s drawing group to get closure on this abortive flirtation. &nbsp;To understand, as she said, what had gone off the rails. &nbsp;Why we weren&rsquo;t suited for each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I replied gratefully to her suggestion, and added a comment or two. &nbsp;She replied&hellip; and by the time we had met a few days later, we&rsquo;d sent each other dozens of more messages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our meeting ended up having a different character than I had expected: &nbsp;Rather than a closure, it was an opening. &nbsp;We talked of &hellip; not of what was wrong, but of what we wanted. &nbsp;And more specifically, of a relationship together. &nbsp; And that we didn&rsquo;t want it to be work, but rather just a chance to enjoy each other. &nbsp;We agreed to get together: &nbsp;Anya was living with her husband and daughter, but had a friend who would lend her his house for an afternoon. &nbsp;I could stop by in a few days after an art class, and meet her there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>For the next few days, I could think of nothing but meeting her: &nbsp;of what we would do. &nbsp;I imagined holding her arms behind her back and kissing her throat. &nbsp;Then removing her clothing, one item at a time. Then making her kneel in front of me and taking me in her mouth. &nbsp;Then fucking her. &nbsp; I imagined how she would taste, and the noises she would make when she came. &nbsp;But </span><span class="c9">really</span><span class="c1">, my expectations were low: &nbsp;I kept telling myself how the first time never worked out well, to temper my hopes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the appointed day, I showed up at her friend&rsquo;s place. &nbsp;Anya let me in. &nbsp; We looked at each other nervously. &nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t say much, or do much. &nbsp;We wondered what would happen. &nbsp;Eventually I gently grabbed her hands and pulled them behind her. &nbsp; She looked shocked, and quickly pulled herself free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What were you thinking?&rdquo; she demanded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, err &hellip; well, I had this fantasy,&rdquo; I mumbled. &nbsp; She made me tell her the fantasy: &nbsp;holding her, making her kneel, etc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oooh, that&rsquo;s very aggressive! You must be very angry with women,&rdquo; she spat out. &nbsp;&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be doing that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Off to this rather ignominious start, we sat down to take stock. &nbsp;We talked for a while, wondering what would happen. &nbsp;We talked about how we weren&rsquo;t sure what we were doing. We said that maybe this wasn&rsquo;t a good idea. &nbsp;It seemed like the sexy get together wouldn&rsquo;t actually happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, gradually, imperceptibly, our hands drifted over toward the other. &nbsp;Shy smiles were exchanged. &nbsp;The words slowed&hellip; then things started moving more quickly. &nbsp;We kissed. Hands fondled each other&rsquo;s torsos. Clothing started coming off&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soon I found myself with my mouth exploring Anya&rsquo;s newly waxed pussy, slipping my tongue over her wet, smooth lips&hellip; She came a couple of times&hellip; This was already a record for me, in the orgasm-inducing category, as for Mary one was alway enough. &nbsp;Then we fucked&hellip; and she came (or came close) again, as did I. &nbsp;Then I went down on her some more, inducing at least one more orgasm&hellip; after some considerable amount of time (half an hour? An hour? More? Anyway, way more than I was used to) we slowed to a stop. &nbsp;Anya had had enough, and waved me off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was stunned &hellip; we&rsquo;d had sex. &nbsp;And it was great. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d made her come, several times, perhaps as many as three or four, more than I&rsquo;d ever experienced with a woman. &nbsp; I&rsquo;d done it, first time! &nbsp;It was way better than it had ever been with Mary. &nbsp;On the first time. &nbsp;Wow! &nbsp;What would be next?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We talked and listened to music for a while. &nbsp;Then cleaned up, carefully: Anya didn&rsquo;t want to leave the slightest mess behind for her friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Driving home, I was elated: &nbsp;This was what it meant to have really great sex! &nbsp;Sex with a partner who enjoyed it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so began our affair - torrid, volatile, life changing.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A shriek and a laugh came from ahead, where Monica had stepped unexpectedly into a small pool of water and flooded her boot. &nbsp;Jack steadied her. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amber smiled at me and said, &ldquo;Ooh, an affair! &nbsp;How exciting!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, for a long time we mostly fucked in cars. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d go to Cherry beach late at night and make out. &nbsp;Anya would give me a blow job, and sometimes touch herself. &nbsp;Sometimes one of us would clamber over the stick shift and we&rsquo;d actually fuck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We started hanging out several nights a week. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d go to drawing together. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d head to Cherry beach to snog. &nbsp; We&rsquo;d email.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One time we went bowling - it was like the perfect teen date. &nbsp; One of us would roll a strike or a spare, and we&rsquo;d hug in delight. &nbsp;I felt so in love.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I particularly enjoyed how much Anya appreciated me: &nbsp;she&rsquo;d tell me how handsome I was, and how generous I was, and how she adored me. &nbsp;I hadn&rsquo;t heard words like that for a long time. &nbsp;For a very long time. &nbsp;Perhaps not since my mother told me things like that - things that I really needed to hear. Finally some positive feedback.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To my surprise, as the affair grew, I found myself being more appreciative of Mary. &nbsp; I started seeing all the good things about her that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed for a long time. &nbsp; How well she cooked. &nbsp;How beautiful the music she played was. &nbsp;How much she cared about the kids. &nbsp; For the first time in years, possibly in our relationship, I found myself falling in love with her. &nbsp; With the care and comfort and commitment of my marriage, and the excitement and growth and curiosity of my affair, I finally felt that my relationship needs and desires were being met. &nbsp;I started feeling grateful for my life. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anya and I &nbsp;conducted our affair without being terribly careful, but we tried to avoid being caught. &nbsp;One day Anya had a special invitation: &nbsp;Some of her drawings would be shown at an interesting venue: &nbsp;Xanadu, a sex club. &nbsp;Anya was excited but terrified: &nbsp;Would I come with her to Xanadu, to be her chaperone? &nbsp; I was nervous but thrilled about the possibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the night of the opening, we were both excited and on edge. &nbsp;What would this be like? &nbsp;Would people try to molest us? &nbsp;Would it be depraved? &nbsp;We dressed up - Anya had a predilection for sexy get ups assembled from vintage store finds - and headed, very late (or so it seemed), to the club. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d been told to arrive after 9.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we arrived, we found the club crowded with mostly middle-aged patrons, mostly of no particular beauty, dressed in sexy, trashy lingerie, or towels. &nbsp; We were stunned at seeing people of all ages and sizes wearing skimpy clothing, the kind you might expect a stripper to wear at the beginning of his or her act. &nbsp; We tiptoed around gingerly, not knowing what to expect in the way of conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Anya, much more outgoing than I, quickly started up one conversation, then another. &nbsp;Everyone we talked to seemed surprisingly warm and open and relaxed. &nbsp;People told us their relationship stories, about their sex lives and predilections, and sometimes about their kids or their lovers or their spouses. &nbsp; We learned that many people were married and genuinely liked or loved their spouses, but found that they wanted more sexual energy than they had with their spouse. &nbsp;Sometimes they would come together, and in other cases the spouse would stay at home, sometimes with the kids, sometimes with another partner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of the people were polyamorous, in that they had multiple sexual or romantic relationships, and everyone involved knew about it, and was ok with it. &nbsp; &nbsp;While I&rsquo;d heard the word polyamory before, it was something I&rsquo;d never encountered in real life, and assumed it was some rarity on the fringes of society. &nbsp; At Xanadu I started to learn that it was a relationship choice that was surprisingly common, just hidden from plain sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anya and I told some of the patrons we met that we were having an affair - that we were married, but not to each other. &nbsp;No one seemed to bat an eye.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anya and I didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;play&rdquo; (as I learned that doing sexy things was called in that world) at Xanadu, but we were pretty turned on and had a fun and sexy debrief session in the car aftward. &nbsp;Anya decided that she wanted to go back and learn more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the next few days, Anya made a deal with the management at Xanadu: &nbsp;She would come and do erotic life drawing, and they would let her in for free. &nbsp;And she could bring a guest, which was usually me. &nbsp;She could come as often as she liked, as long as she told them when she was coming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We started going to Xanadu regularly, as often as once a week. &nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t play (have sex) with each other at first, but we watched others playing, and talked with the patrons, when we weren&rsquo;t drawing. &nbsp; And eventually we worked up the courage to play at the club, first in a private room, then eventually in the public rooms, where we could see other people playing, as they watched us. &nbsp; People would invite us to join them, but we never did play with others. &nbsp;For us, being seen as we played, and enjoying hearing and seeing other people play, was enough. &nbsp; The sounds of women sighing and moaning and men grunting was a huge turn on for both of us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each time we went to Xanadu we would learn more. &nbsp;We would make friends and learn people&rsquo;s stories, of swinging and polyamory and kink and relationship conflict and so on. &nbsp;It was fascinating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I learned more, I started to realize that what I was doing was kind of like polyamory: &nbsp;I was seeing two people to meet my needs. &nbsp;The only issue was that it was secret - it was cheating. &nbsp;I decided I wanted to fix that, by telling Mary about the affair, and about my feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anya was horrified. &nbsp;She asked me, &ldquo;Can you guarantee that nothing bad will happen if you tell her? &nbsp; Will she come after me? &nbsp;Or my kid?&rdquo; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I realized that this conversation would be tricky, and I didn&rsquo;t have any guarantee of success. &nbsp;So I decided to try to build some common ground with Mary first, to identify some overall challenges in our relationship, and to try to get agreement on how to address those. &nbsp;I thought that that could give some practice in having those conversations, and build some shared understanding before we got to the more challenging stuff. &nbsp;So I teed up about 8 or 10 topics of conversation, starting with a first&hellip; and almost immediately stalled. &nbsp;It became clear that this would be hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One night I came home particularly late from Xanadu. &nbsp;There had been an engrossing kinky sex demonstration, and it had triggered a fight with Anya: &nbsp;She had told me that she would enjoy being dominated the way the woman was in the scene, and I had laughed, because in my experience Anya absolutely hated being controlled in any way. &nbsp;This didn&rsquo;t go over well, and Anya went home in a huff, leaving me to make my way home alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next morning, Mary asked me pointedly where I had been, and with whom. &nbsp; I told her that I&rsquo;d been at a drawing event. &nbsp;She asked where. &nbsp;I refused to answer, telling her that I would like to tell her, but I wasn&rsquo;t ready. &nbsp;That we needed to have a conversation about some other things first. &nbsp;Mary was unhappy with my answer, but accepted it for the moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, as all of this was happening, things were getting much more complicated with Juliet. &nbsp;She had found dealing with school and interacting with other students to be increasingly challenging, and she was showing all kinds of signs of stress. &nbsp; In the fall she had a mini nervous breakdown, and was home from school for some weeks. &nbsp;Come January, 2013, she was back at school, but still struggling. &nbsp;On one business trip to New York that January, I found myself in tears as Mary told me about Juliet&rsquo;s challenges, which was rather unusual for me: &nbsp;I cried only very rarely. &nbsp; Those tears foreshadowed a lot more tears that year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As that winter turned to spring, things continued to bubble. &nbsp;My affair with Anya heated up, my feelings for Mary warmed up, my difficult conversations with Mary went in circles, and Juliet started bouncing off the walls, stressed about school and relationships. &nbsp;One day she left out a poem for Mary and me in which she declared herself to be attracted to girls. &nbsp; Mary and I were slightly puzzled, because we&rsquo;d seen her with crushes on a couple of boys in previous years, but thought, sure, that&rsquo;s fine, if that&rsquo;s true at least we don&rsquo;t have to worry about her getting pregnant at 16. &nbsp; So we didn&rsquo;t make a deal of the note, telling her thanks for telling us, and that we were fine with it, and that we hoped she&rsquo;d have a good day. &nbsp; In retrospect perhaps that wasn&rsquo;t the best possible way of handling it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That afternoon we got a call from the Vice Principal at her school, someone we&rsquo;d got to know pretty well by that point: &nbsp; Juliet was in her office, beside herself with anxiety. &nbsp;Apparently, the VP said, &nbsp;Juliet had told her that she&rsquo;d come out to us, and that she didn&rsquo;t know how we felt about it, and she was scared. &nbsp; Rather surprised, we got Juliet home for a conversation, reiterating that we were fine with her choices, that we just wanted her to be happy. &nbsp;This seemed to mollify Juliet for that day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sometime later, one Sunday afternoon, Mary asked me if I could help Juliet as she cleaned up her room. &nbsp; I swung up to Juliet&rsquo;s third floor loft and found her on the floor, surrounded by a couple of dozen artworks lying on the floor around her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? &nbsp;How can I help?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Juliet answered, stressed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to organize my art so I know where to put it, but I don&rsquo;t know what to do. &nbsp; I need you to help me.&rdquo; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I crouched beside her. &nbsp;&ldquo;How are you trying to organize it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She told me that she wanted to put her art into three categories &hellip; art works she wanted to hang, items she wanted to put away into storage, and items she would keep out to have around to work on for inspiration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I told her that this seemed pretty reasonable, and we worked out that she could put the items in three piles, and where to put the piles. &nbsp; As we talked about her organizational system, Juliet seemed to calm down. &nbsp; I suggested she could try starting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pulled out the first piece. &nbsp;She talked about it for a minute. &nbsp; I emitted a few noncommittal grunts. &nbsp;She decided that she would put that item away, and put it in the &ldquo;to store&rdquo; pile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pulled out the next piece. &nbsp;She considered it, looked it over. &nbsp;She put it in the pile to be hung on the wall. &nbsp;She looked like she was getting in the zone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the third, she quickly figured out what to do. &nbsp;As she put the item on the destined pile, I noticed that I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything, and that Juliet seemed to be in the groove. &nbsp;I thought it was an opportunity to teach her some independence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I said, &ldquo;Hey, I can see you don&rsquo;t need me at the moment. I&rsquo;ll head downstairs and work on my own stuff, and if you need me you can call me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This comment didn&rsquo;t go over well. &nbsp; Juliet wailed, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go! &nbsp;I need you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I answered less compassionately than I might wish I had. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just sat through the last three pieces you decided on, and you didn&rsquo;t need to ask me anything. I&rsquo;m sitting here doing nothing. &nbsp;I can go downstairs and let you work on this by yourself, and any time you run into trouble, I can come back and help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Juliet continued to argue, &ldquo;Dad, I need you! &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t do this without you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I answered tartly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nearly sixteen years old and completely capable of cleaning your room by yourself. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m happy to help you figure out how to do it, but I&rsquo;m not keen on sitting here doing nothing while you figure out for yourself what you want where. &nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be downstairs. &nbsp;Call me when you need me!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I got up and headed out of the room. &nbsp;Juliet yelled after me, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand! &nbsp; I need your help! &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t do it without you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I yelled back as I headed down the stairs, &ldquo;YOU don&rsquo;t understand! &nbsp;You need to learn how to take care of things by yourself. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re old enough to do it, and I want you to learn how.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stomped down to the second floor, and stood, shaking, feeling very upset and frustrated and unsure of myself. &nbsp; I paused for a moment to collect myself. &nbsp; At that moment, Juliet came storming down the stairs, screeching and wailing like a banshee, traveling at an enormous velocity. &nbsp; I instantly feared that she&rsquo;d continue headlong down the main stairs and out the front door and out into the afternoon, to disappear into the city, a spirited teen running amok, and at risk. &nbsp; To forestall this fate, I reached out my arms to grab her and hold her back as she sailed by.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My effort stalled her only a moment. &nbsp;She tried to push my arms away, and I tightened my grip. &nbsp;She pushed harder, and I squeezed back. &nbsp;Then she bit my hand. &nbsp; I instantly realized that I couldn&rsquo;t do this, that this wasn&rsquo;t right, and I completely let go, defeated. &nbsp; Juliet headed down the main steps and out the front door. &nbsp;But I could see through the window that she had sat down on the front step, by the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided to give her a few minutes to cool off (and myself), and that then I would go to talk to her, and apologize. &nbsp; So about five minutes later, I opened the front door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing. &nbsp;To my surprise, Juliet was gone. &nbsp; I looked up the street, and down the street, and around the corner. &nbsp;No sign of her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Worried, I told Mary that I was heading out after Juliet. &nbsp; I got in the car, figuring it could cover ground more quickly. &nbsp;I drove around all the nearby streets, looking for any signs of Juliet. I gradually drove bigger and bigger circles. &nbsp;My anxiety grew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I drove, the enormity of what had happened started to sink in. &nbsp; I worried for my daughter, and judged myself for having done the wrong thing, though I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the right thing would have been. &nbsp;I found myself in the port lands, driving past waste dumps and old generating stations and cement plants, with a huge lump in my throat and tears in my eyes. &nbsp; Periodically I checked in with Mary. &nbsp;No word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ended up finding a parking spot not too far from where Anya and I would go to snog late at night, near Cherry beach. &nbsp;I guess it was a familiar and comforting locale. &nbsp;I hung my head, leaned against the steering wheel of the car, and wept. &nbsp;I felt that I had done the wrong thing, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure what -that I had done my best, and had failed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After an hour or two of soul-searching and self-flagellation and crying, I got a call from Mary: &nbsp;Juliet had been located. &nbsp;She was at the local mall, and had been found by mall security at closing time, looking somewhat lost and confused, and had given our name and address. &nbsp; &nbsp;I headed home, arriving shortly before Juliet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I confess that I don&rsquo;t really remember much of our reunion. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to think that I was relieved that Juliet was home safe, and apologetic for grabbing her that way, and the way I spoke to her. &nbsp;But I fear that most of those feelings were unspoken, that no one knew exactly what to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c9">[consulting mom]</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Monica, still walking in a squishy boot, remarked quietly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard sometimes to know what to do with kids, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt144" id="cmnt_ref144">[en]</a></sup></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c3 c22" id="h.fl0jr2e8mfuy"><span class="c13"></span></h1><h1 class="c3" id="h.ma2faese31c"><span class="c13">Chapter 14: Cataclysm</span></h1><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>An entry frame</span><sup><a href="#cmnt145" id="cmnt_ref145">[eo]</a></sup></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Around this time, Colleen came to the gallery to pose for life drawing. &nbsp;Colleen was in her early 30s , blonde, slender and toned from yoga, and was beautiful and expressive. &nbsp;She had a squarish chin that looked finely elegant in person, but in all my drawings looked masculine and rough, to my immense chagrin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I loved drawing Colleen and persuaded her to come back to pose again. &nbsp; Chatting with her, I mentioned that I had a dream to draw a nude model at a piano. &nbsp; Her interest was piqued, and she immediately said she would like to pose for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was delighted but terrified about this prospect. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d previously arranged to do this with another model, but I&rsquo;d been anxious about it and had come across as creepy, and she&rsquo;d bailed on it. &nbsp; So I didn&rsquo;t want that to happen again. &nbsp; I asked her to come out for a tea after the life drawing class the next time she posed so we could talk about it and agree on expectations. &nbsp; To my surprise, the chat went smoothly and all seemed like it could work well. &nbsp;I found myself quite liking Colleen. &nbsp; After we&rsquo;d talked through all the details, I thanked her for her time and commented that she would probably want to be going. &nbsp; To my even greater surprise, she demurred, saying that she was enjoying the conversation and would be happy to continue it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We talked for close to an hour, forming an easy rapport. &nbsp;I was stunned, because I&rsquo;d always felt anxious and unconfident around women, particularly attractive women, and Colleen was a stunner, and lovely and kind to boot. &nbsp; As we left, I felt like a million dollars. &nbsp;I thought to myself, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m not as awful to be around as I thought! &nbsp;Life is good!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anya, who&rsquo;d also drawn Colleen, was also gaga about drawing her, and asked if she could join us when Colleen posed at my place. &nbsp;This seemed like a reasonable idea, so we would have a chaperone, to make things feel a bit safer. &nbsp; &nbsp;Following all of this, I double checked with Mary that she was ok with all of this. &nbsp;(I&rsquo;d already told her of my dream and got her approval.) &nbsp;Mary said she was fine with Colleen posing, but we&rsquo;d need to find a way to keep the kids away during the session.) &nbsp;I agreed with Colleen that we&rsquo;d do a few sessions until the drawings were satisfactory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After this, Anya struck up a friendship with Colleen, quickly finding out about her: &nbsp;Colleen was an actress who had moved recently from BC to Toronto. &nbsp;Anya and I watched the independent film that she had a supporting role in. &nbsp; And even better, Colleen would soon be playing on stage in a major role in a fairly large theatre in North York, with a well-regarded community theatre company. &nbsp; Anya and I decided to go together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The night of the performance Anya and I drove up to the theatre and parked. &nbsp;A few minutes early, we decided to chat. &nbsp;As we waited in the car, my phone rang. &nbsp;It was Juliet, panicky, calling from home. &nbsp;She said something indecipherable but scary, something about hurting herself. &nbsp;The call dropped. &nbsp;Frantic, I called back, but Juliet didn&rsquo;t answer. &nbsp; &nbsp;But I received a text from her, saying that she had decided to end it, and had cut her wrist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Terrified, I called Mary. &nbsp;She told me that she had been at the museum with Brad, and had left Juliet at home, and that she was sure Juliet would be fine, that she was acting out. &nbsp;Mary would be home in twenty minutes or half an hour and would be able to see what was going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This calm dismissal of what seemed to be a life-threatening situation just didn&rsquo;t compute for me. &nbsp;I decided that I needed to act. &nbsp; I called 911 and spoke to the emergency operator, who promised to send police with a mental health response unit. &nbsp;They would be there in a few minutes, she said. Juliet would be safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I held my head in my hands for a moment, unsure what to do, feeling quite at a loss. &nbsp;Then after a few seconds I told Anya I was going home. &nbsp;I waited only long enough for her to hop out of the car, so at least she could see Colleen perform, and headed back home as quick as I could go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ride back was surreal: &nbsp; I headed along highways at breakneck speeds, weaving through traffic in ways I&rsquo;d seen assholes do, but never done myself. &nbsp;I came down the winding Don Valley Parkway often exceeding 150 km/h, feeling like a Formula 1 race car driver as I weaved around the other cars, taking curves inside or outside to get the best line, drifting across lines and through the shoulder. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t care if I was stopped for speeding - I had something more important to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I was home in no time - under 15 minutes, much less than the usual trip time for the 24 kilometer trip. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt146" id="cmnt_ref146">[ep]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp; When I arrived at home, there was a collection of emergency vehicles gathered around our home, flashers spinning. &nbsp; I raced inside, my heart in my mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were several uniformed cops standing around talking among themselves. &nbsp;Juliet was sitting on a sofa, talking with a female police officer, looking pale but otherwise healthy. &nbsp;There was no sign of blood. &nbsp; A cop pulled me aside to make a statement: &nbsp;Where had I been, what did Juliet tell me, and so on. &nbsp; Eventually the lady cop came over to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Juliet, she said, had apparently smashed one of my art prints, </span><span>a Victorian lady standing near the spire of St. Martin in the Fields in London, painted by James Tissot, </span><sup><a href="#cmnt147" id="cmnt_ref147">[eq]</a></sup><span class="c1">and had used the shards of the glazing to score her wrists. &nbsp;But the glazing wasn&rsquo;t glass, just acrylic, and so it hadn&rsquo;t cut her, just scratched her. &nbsp; She was scratched badly, multiple times, but there was no more than a droplet or two of blood. &nbsp;She said this wasn&rsquo;t uncommon: teenagers would often attempt to hurt themselves as a cry for attention, but without actually wanting to kill themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The next week everything was disrupted: &nbsp; Shortly after the suicide attempt, Juliet checked herself into the psychiatric ward at </span><span class="c9">Toronto East General Hospital</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;With heavy hearts we accompanied her there, swallowing at seeing the locked ward, protected behind a locked foyer. &nbsp;We learned that Juliet wouldn&rsquo;t be free to come and go, and would be expected to stay for a several day period to adjust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day we got an anguished call: &nbsp;Juliet. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hi mom, hi dad&hellip; &nbsp; This place is terrible. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t sleep. &nbsp; Kids were moving around all night. &nbsp;and making noise. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m so unhappy! &nbsp;Please come and take me home!&rdquo; &nbsp; Her grief and anguish was palpable. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt a lump in my throat. &nbsp; We promised to talk to the ward supervisors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hours later, after several tense calls with the administrators, we convinced them to spring Juliet from confinement the next morning, if she still wanted out. &nbsp; We reasoned that since she had been voluntarily committed, and since she no longer wanted to be there, they ought to let her out, even if they normally had a policy to keep patients in for 3 or 4 days. &nbsp;They had to think about that for a long time, and consult supervisors, but eventually agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the appointed hour Mary and I arrived at the visitor lobby for the TEGH psych ward. We were told to wait. &nbsp; We waited, and waited. &nbsp;Eventually, Juliet shambled outward, lugging her overnight bag, looking forlorn and lost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I rushed towards her, towards the locked door, arms outstretched, a pang of relief suffusing my chest. Once the door was unlocked and she spied me, she also rushed towards me, a huge smile on her face. &nbsp;We hugged. &nbsp; &nbsp;I had a vision of that old movie trope where a man and a woman run across a field towards each in slow motion, eventually embracing in a tight hug. &nbsp;Mary stood back, with a small smile on her face, then slowly walked over to embrace her daughter. &nbsp; Then that movie glow faded, and the grim, grey surroundings of the pysch ward reappeared, and we hurried out of that horrible place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next few weeks continued unsettled. &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to leave Juliet alone, so the next Saturday I took her with me to my art class at my traditional atelier. &nbsp; A lovely woman with a daughter a little older than Juliet took my daughter under her wing for the day. &nbsp;I saw the two of them happily talking away and working on art. &nbsp;My relief and gratitude were immense. &nbsp;The lady told me that she&rsquo;d been through a lot with her daughter, so she had some idea of what to do and say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I next saw Anya, she was curious about Juliet, and asked me to tell about everything that had happened. &nbsp;She also told me about the show that Colleen was in, the one that I&rsquo;d missed: &nbsp; &ldquo;It was amazing,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d been there, you&rsquo;d have completely fallen in love with Colleen,&rdquo; she gushed. &nbsp;It seemed clear that Anya was also rather taken with the young actress/model.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few weeks passed before our first drawing session with Colleen. &nbsp;We found a time when Mary and the kids would be out for a weekend afternoon. &nbsp; The three of us gathered in the music room of my house, near Mary&rsquo;s grand piano. &nbsp; We chatted. &nbsp; Colleen told us something about her upbringing. &nbsp;She was kind and caring, if slightly guarded. &nbsp; She was curious about me and about my children, and asked a lot of questions about Juliet. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found myself really enjoying talking with Colleen, her liveliness and warmth and gentle demeanor. &nbsp; &nbsp;And Anya was beside herself with curiosity about her new friend. &nbsp; &nbsp;We did some initial sketches that day, but didn&rsquo;t really make a lot of progress, other than getting to know each other, and feeling a little more relaxed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterward, I found myself in a daze: &nbsp;I clearly had a crush on Colleen, a huge crush. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t believe that this beautiful young woman would be so curious about me. &nbsp; I loved her questions, her kind and compassionate suggestions. &nbsp;And the stories she told of her family life, of how she had cared for her disabled brother for years. &nbsp; She was quiet and thoughtful and curious and warm, not at all how I imagined beautiful women.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time, even though I was having an affair with Anya, so had broken my marriage vows, and even though I could feel a nice, warm vibe from Colleen, I couldn&rsquo;t really see myself propositioning Colleen. &nbsp;The age gap was too much, and she clearly was interested in younger men. &nbsp;I was more of a curiosity, an interesting middle aged man, than a true attraction. My crush was clearly going to be unrequited in the romantic sense, but I could still look forward to seeing her again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I could flirt with her &hellip; when we had moved from the Poconos to Canada, we had brought our hot tub with us, and I flirted with Anya and Colleen that after our next drawing session we could all jump into the hot tub together, bathing suits not required. &nbsp; I fantasized about that possibility, but the fantasies went no further than having a fun, naked spin in the hot tub with my sexy mistress and a beautiful young woman who seemed to like us both. &nbsp; I tried to push my fantasies further, but they wouldn&rsquo;t go: &nbsp;Even in my imagination, Colleen was off limits. &nbsp;I might have a crush on her, but couldn&rsquo;t imagine having sex with her. &nbsp;In any event, Colleen playfully flirted back that she&rsquo;d have to think about the offer, that it might get too hot in the hot tub&hellip; &nbsp;maybe another time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually a day came when Colleen could pose with the piano again. &nbsp; It was an evening that the kids were going out to a graduation dance. &nbsp;They would be out until well after 9 pm when the dance ended, so no need to tell them. &nbsp;Mary and I arranged that I would do the drawing with Colleen while Mary visited friends. &nbsp;Anya wasn&rsquo;t available, so we were unchaperoned last night, but the previous get togethers had relaxed us both, and everything seemed fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To keep the spirit of relaxation, I made up a cheese board for us and opened a bottle of wine, of a type that I had acquired that I thought would be to Colleen&rsquo;s taste. &nbsp; I put some music on the stereo. &nbsp;Colleen and I talked, and then she posed for me, and I drew. &nbsp;My drawings were disappointing: &nbsp;the figures were ok, but the faces were heavy, crude, ugly. &nbsp;We tried different poses, to see what would give the best effect. &nbsp;We talked. &nbsp;We paused, and had cheese and crackers, and drank wine, which she enjoyed greatly. We talked of family and values. The mood was quiet and relaxed, connective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>All of a sudden, there was a clatter from the front door downstairs. &nbsp; Startled, I checked the time: &nbsp;it was shortly after 8, well before the kids were supposed to arrive. &nbsp; I </span><span>called</span><sup><a href="#cmnt148" id="cmnt_ref148">[er]</a></sup><span class="c1">, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Juliet answered, in high spirits, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s us, Dad. &nbsp;The dance ended early. &nbsp;We had a great time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking around at the area around me, and imagining how the kids might see it, I was horrified: &nbsp; I was drinking a glass of wine with a beautiful, young, naked woman, who was sitting at their mother&rsquo;s piano, also holding a glass of wine. &nbsp;The wine bottle was nearly empty. &nbsp;There was the remains of a cheese board on a counter. &nbsp;Soft music was playing on the stereo. &nbsp;Mary was out, visiting a friend. &nbsp;It was clearly, it seemed, a date, not a drawing encounter. &nbsp;And it would appear to be behind Mary&rsquo;s back. &nbsp;And I realized that Juliet would immediately come bounding up the stairs to the open concept second floor, on the way to her bedroom, and see Colleen, not so many years older than she, in the altogether. &nbsp;With her father. &nbsp;I felt like I had been caught in bed with a woman other than my wife. &nbsp;Like I was cheating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I yelled downstairs, my voice quivering, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come up! &nbsp;I&rsquo;m finishing something and need a few minutes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The kids went, &ldquo;Whaaat!!??&rdquo; &nbsp;Colleen looked surprised and bemused, but said nothing. &nbsp; Downstairs, Brad and Juliet chattered about what was going on, and then about the party they&rsquo;d been at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I told Colleen that we&rsquo;d need to stop now, and clean up, and that she&rsquo;d need to dress. &nbsp; &nbsp;She immediately understood, and quickly donned her clothing, while I tried to clear the cheese board and put everything around the piano in position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A couple of minutes later the two of us headed downstairs, with me looking guilt-ridden and embarrassed. &nbsp;Colleen just smiled hello to Juliet and hi to Brad, and headed out the door after giving me a hug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I turned to face them. They gaped at me, clearly wondering who this beautiful young woman was who had so warmly hugged their father and had headed out the door. &nbsp;&ldquo;What was going on? &nbsp;Why couldn&rsquo;t we go upstairs?&rdquo; &nbsp;Their questions were reasonable, bu</span><span>t I was tentative and evasive in my answers</span><sup><a href="#cmnt149" id="cmnt_ref149">[es]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing was going on,&rdquo; I said, defensively, looking away. &nbsp;&ldquo;We were just drawing.&rdquo; &nbsp; Juliet looked at me with disbelief and reproach. &nbsp; She headed upstairs to her room. &nbsp;On the way through the second floor she passed the remains of our wine &amp; cheese, which cowered forlornly, discarded so unceremoniously a few minutes ago. &nbsp;Brad silently ducked away to his basement lair. &nbsp; A few minutes later I headed to the second floor and finished clearing away our snack. &nbsp;The house was silent.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; said Dan. &nbsp;&ldquo;Uncomfortable!! &hellip;.

It was clear that she wasn&rsquo;t impressed. &nbsp;And it was clear that she wasn&rsquo;t going to try to explain or mediate or connect. &nbsp;I was on my own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Life continued in our home, somewhat out of balance. &nbsp;Juliet barely spoke with me. &nbsp;Mary was reserved, saying enough to manage the basic necessities of life, but otherwise apparently uninterested in pursuing discussions about Colleen. &nbsp; I kept busy, with financial industry conference calls and art classes and spending time out evenings with Anya.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Some days later, one evening at bedtime, </span><span>Mary </span><span class="c9">started </span><span>a conversation with me.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt150" id="cmnt_ref150">[et]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Why are you so mean with the kids?&rdquo; she </span><span class="c9">started</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Startled, I said, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She told me that I was always stomping and storming around and yelling. &nbsp; And that she wanted me to change. &nbsp;There was a strongly implied &ldquo;or else.&rdquo; &nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t clear what the &ldquo;or else&rdquo; would be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked her for an example of when I was mean to the kids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She talked about how I would yell at Juliet in the morning, and stomp around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>She was talking about the days that I would get up before 6 am to make breakfast for Juliet, who had to be at school before 7 for the swim team practices she had unexpectedly signed up for. On those days, I would head up two stories to her room before I started making breakfast, and call at first quietly and then louder from outside her door until she woke up and acknowledged me. &nbsp;(She would set her alarm, but almost invariably either </span><span class="c9">mess it up</span><sup><a href="#cmnt151" id="cmnt_ref151">[eu]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;or sleep through it.) &nbsp; Once she </span><span>was awak</span><sup><a href="#cmnt152" id="cmnt_ref152">[ev]</a></sup><span class="c1">e, I would head back downstairs and start breakfast. &nbsp; If there was no sign of movement after another ten minutes or so, I would head upstairs again, this time calling up from the second floor, a little louder. &nbsp;Then back to the kitchen to keep the eggs from burning. Sometimes I&rsquo;d have to do this three or more times. &nbsp;Each time I would go up the stairs faster and need to yell louder to keep everything on schedule. &nbsp;Because each day we&rsquo;d have to fly like the wind to get to the school in time for Juliet to make the deadline for practice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pondered how this morning routine would sound to Mary. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s true that I have to run up the stairs and that I need to yell, but it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m angry or mean. &nbsp; I mean, Juliet asked me to help her get to swim team on time, and wants me to wake her up.&rdquo; &nbsp; Mary didn&rsquo;t look particularly satisfied, commenting that I seemed so angry when I did it, but agreed that this was something that Juliet had asked for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked Mary for another example of how mean I was to the kids. &nbsp; She brought up the room cleaning incident, talking about how I was mean not to help Juliet clean her room. &nbsp; This one caught me hard. &nbsp;I knew I hadn&rsquo;t handled it very well. &nbsp;But I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I&rsquo;d been mean&hellip; but maybe I was?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had an appointment with my therapist the next day (I&rsquo;d been seeing her for a few months, at the insistence of both Mary and Anya). &nbsp;I told her about Mary&rsquo;s criticism, and asked if she thought I&rsquo;d been mean during the room-cleaning incident. &nbsp; &nbsp;We talked it through, again, and she said, &ldquo;Well, maybe you didn&rsquo;t handle that as well as you could have, and maybe that could be seen as mean. &nbsp;But you had some good reasons for what you did, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem that bad to me. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen lots of parents do much meaner things, for no good reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she said, &ldquo;Ask Mary to give you another example of when you were mean to the kids.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that night I said to Mary, &ldquo;OK, I don&rsquo;t think that incident was so bad, but maybe it was. &nbsp;I agree that I might have been mean that time. &nbsp;But can you give another example of when I was mean to the kids?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary paused and thought. &nbsp;And thought. &nbsp;And then she said, &ldquo;Well, your demeanor is mean a lot of the time, but I can&rsquo;t give you a specific example.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I parroted what my therapist suggested. &ldquo;Well, if you can&rsquo;t give me an example, it&rsquo;s hard for me to know what to do to change. &nbsp; Can you please let me know the next time you think I&rsquo;m being mean to them?&rdquo; &nbsp;Mary looked unimpressed, but reluctantly assented.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few days later Mary and I went out of the house for a tea to talk about the issues between us, the first of many such get togethers at that coffee house. &nbsp; It was a difficult, unresolved conversation. &nbsp;Mary continued to push the theme that I needed to be different. &nbsp;I told Mary that I wasn&rsquo;t angry with her, but that I had stopped guessing what she wanted. &nbsp;If she wanted me to do something, she would need to be specific. &nbsp;To give specific examples, and make specific requests. &nbsp;That I wasn&rsquo;t just doing things anymore because I thought she might like it. &nbsp; At the end of the conversation I felt better that I felt that had made my position clear, and had stood up for myself. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure what Mary thought of the conversation, but I got an inkling in the coming days.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The following Friday night Mary and Juliet performed at the class performance of the introductory belly dancing class they had been attending. &nbsp;It was a little ironic for me, because I had dragged the whole family to one or two belly dancing events a year or two before - and I had been teased mercilessly for it, told how inappropriate it was, that I was being lewd. &nbsp;But apparently something had stuck with the ladies in the family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The performance that night had a wide range of performers, from the nervous and shy beginners, to several excellent and skilled solo performers. &nbsp; It ended up being a good time, the first time that the family had been together and had a good time for a long time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That night, as we were in bed getting ready for sleep, Mary said that she had something to tell me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to help you but you refuse. &nbsp;I want you to be better but there&rsquo;s nothing I can do. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t listen to me when I try to help. You continue to be mean to the kids, and I need to protect them. &nbsp;I want you to leave. &nbsp;For the good of the kids. &nbsp;As soon as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She lay down and rolled over, facing away from me, silent. &nbsp; I sat up in bed, stunned. &nbsp;My stomach churned. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stayed there for ten minutes or so, thoughts awhirl, until I realized that I couldn&rsquo;t sleep in that bed, even stay in that bed, after what Mary had said. &nbsp; &nbsp;I got out of bed and headed up to my office, which had a sofa, and found some blankets, and rolled up in it. &nbsp; I spent hours lying awake, tossing and turning, wondering what to do, worrying about what was next. &nbsp; Wondering about how and when we would tell the kids. &nbsp;Eventually, I slept.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next morning, a Saturday, I emerged groggily from my office to talk to Mary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How are we going to tell the kids?&rdquo; &nbsp;I asked, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I already told them,&rdquo; she responded, tartly. &nbsp;&ldquo;I got them up early to talk to them. &nbsp;I told them that I asked you to leave to protect them, because you weren&rsquo;t good for them right now. &nbsp;I said that you loved them and had tried your best to be a good father, but &hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp; The rest that she said faded into a blur, as a roaring filled my ears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was stunned. &nbsp; This didn&rsquo;t seem like how you tell the kids about something like this. &nbsp;Shouldn&rsquo;t I have been part of the conversation? Shouldn&rsquo;t the explanation of why I was leaving be left vague? &nbsp; Did I really need to be thrown under the bus in front of the kids?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The day proceeded awkwardly. &nbsp; &nbsp;There were some stilted conversations with the kids. &nbsp;Juliet &nbsp;said, &nbsp;&ldquo;Mom told us that you are moving out. &nbsp; I know you did your best, Dad. &nbsp;I hope things get better for you.&rdquo; &nbsp;Then she bustled off; neither of us knew what else to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wrote to Anya about what happened, telling her how stunned I felt. &nbsp;Then I realized that this meant that the sessions with Colleen and the piano couldn&rsquo;t happen anymore. &nbsp;I wrote to my lovely model and new friend, briefly explaining the situation, and hoping that we could somehow continue to work together. &nbsp;I expressed my sadness, and commented in closing that this was made harder for me because I had developed complicated feelings towards her in our time working together, and I was afraid of losing that closeness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary and I had previously made plans to go to the Art Gallery of Ontario that afternoon with the kids to see a special exhibition. &nbsp; With the news, Mary begged off going, saying that it didn&rsquo;t feel right to her, and Brad decided to stay with her. &nbsp;Juliet, I think feeling sorry for her dad, said she would come with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We headed off to the exhibit. &nbsp; As we sauntered around, an email came in from Colleen. &nbsp; She briefly expressed sadness about my marriage falling apart, but very quickly came to the point: &nbsp;She was highly disturbed by my comments about my &ldquo;complicated feelings&rdquo; towards her, and said that knowing about these, she wasn&rsquo;t prepared to continue to pose for me&hellip;. That it was too much for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I read her words, I understood where she was coming from&hellip; clearly she didn&rsquo;t want to pose for a middle aged man in the middle of a breakup with his wife who had apparently confessed his love and desire for her. &nbsp; (Which isn&rsquo;t exactly what I was trying to say, but I could see it could be read that way, and maybe it wasn&rsquo;t too far from the truth.) &nbsp; But this rejection - for it felt like a rejection - was almost too much to bear. &nbsp;The only person in my life who was consistently kind and sweet to me, someone whom I&rsquo;d come to enjoy and admire very much, had just in effect told me I wasn&rsquo;t safe to be around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was suddenly stunned with pain and grief. &nbsp; The numbness that I&rsquo;d been feeling since Mary&rsquo;s announcement instantly shifted into pain. The tears welled up in my eyes, and a huge lump formed in my throat. &nbsp; I wavered on my feet. &nbsp;Fortunately Juliet was a few feet away when I read this, and I eased further away from her, and around a corner. &nbsp; &nbsp;I wept quietly for a few minutes, acutely aware of my losses. &nbsp;Of how life was changing, and of how people close to me were rejecting me. &nbsp; I wondered if I deserved it. &nbsp;I thought that perhaps I did. &nbsp;Perhaps I wasn&rsquo;t a good person, after all. &nbsp;Perhaps I was a truly awful person who deserved to be shunned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The day continued in a blur. &nbsp;I gathered myself together, choking down the tears and putting on a grim, blank face for Juliet. I answered Colleen that I understood, and that I hoped she could continue a friendship with Anya. &nbsp;I wrote to Anya about the debacle, and made plans to see her the next day. &nbsp; That night, Mary went to our regular book club. &nbsp;I stayed home, feeling miserable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meeting Anya, the next day at a public square, wasn&rsquo;t much better. &nbsp;She commiserated with me about what had happened with Mary, and wondered what I would do next. &nbsp;But she quickly turned to the email exchange with Colleen, and excoriated me for what I had written to her. &nbsp;Couldn&rsquo;t I see how threatening what I had written would be for Colleen? &nbsp;Couldn&rsquo;t I see that I was implicating her in my breakup, and how unsettling that would be for her? &nbsp;Couldn&rsquo;t I see I had pushed Colleen away, that it was all my fault? Why couldn&rsquo;t I be more aware of the impact of my actions on others, Anya as well as Colleen? &nbsp;And how dare I encourage Colleen to stay friends with her? &nbsp;As she spoke I understood that it was her way of dealing with the grief of what happened, but that didn&rsquo;t make it all feel better. &nbsp;I just felt like I had let everyone down in my life. &nbsp;Tears pricked at my eyes, but I held them back, as best as I could.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c3 c22" id="h.7aygy06zq219"><span class="c13"></span></h1><h1 class="c3" id="h.h5y0enow9ygq"><span class="c13">Chapter 15: More Relating</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Back at the farmhouse, our gang took stock. &nbsp;Monica went to put on dry socks and to warm herself by the fire. &nbsp;Cassandra and Jack started working on dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dan reflected on my story. &nbsp;&ldquo;Gutting. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s absolutely gutting. &nbsp;How did you handle it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the crushing blows of mid-June 2013, things continued to get worse. &nbsp;A few days after all this, Mary encouraged the whole family to go and get ice cream together, as a stab at normalcy. &nbsp;We walked some blocks over to a local gelateria, picked out our sugary delights, and then ambled awkwardly back home. &nbsp;Conversation was desultory and muted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day Mary and I visited a marriage counselor I had found who I hoped could help us with co-parenting. &nbsp;My hopes of reconciling with Mary were dim at best. &nbsp;I told the counselor that the engagement was not about reconciling, but only about establishing a peaceful co-parenting arrangement, not realizing that her focus was only on saving marriages - that I had chosen the wrong kind of advisor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary launched in. &nbsp; &ldquo;Brian is a threat to the kids, and I need him out of the home now. &nbsp;The kids keep telling me how mean he is to him, and how they don&rsquo;t want him around. &nbsp;He needs to learn to be kinder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was stunned, blindsided. &nbsp;Why was this the first I heard about the kids&rsquo; complaints about me? &nbsp;Why did Mary encourage us all to go out together for ice cream the previous day if I was a threat to the kids? &nbsp; Why did it seem that this was a stab in the back, carefully chosen to cause the most damage, delivered with the greatest possible surprise?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I stuttered and stammered to the counselor that I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, that this was all news to me. &nbsp;The counselor pursed her lips and looked down her nose at me, clearly disappointed that I wasn&rsquo;t aware of what my children thought, that I was out so of touch. &nbsp; This incident was the first of a series of incidents - with lawyers and psychiatrists and advisors - where Mary calmly &nbsp;</span><span class="c9">pulled out </span><span>the most damning possible information about me, </span><span class="c9">generally </span><span class="c1">unsubstantiated, making me look as bad as possible in front of an authority. &nbsp;But in direct conversation with me she had nothing to say. &nbsp;I felt like a clumsy bull stabbed by an agile toreador. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The counseling session continued, and we set out our goals for counseling. &nbsp;I reiterated that I wasn&rsquo;t there for reconciliation, just to figure out how to co-parent. &nbsp;The counselor suggested that we meet with her individually in the coming week.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I met with the counselor and asked her whether any information I shared was confidential. &nbsp;In other words, if I told her something, could I trust that she would not pass this information onto Mary? &nbsp;She assured me that everything I said was confidential, that I could trust that she wouldn&rsquo;t pass it on, that I was at liberty to tell her anything. &nbsp; So I told her the situation. &nbsp; I told her that I was having an affair, and that I didn&rsquo;t want the marriage to reconcile, just to figure out how to co-parent. &nbsp; The marriage counselor stopped me: &nbsp;&ldquo;You need to tell her immediately about the affair if you want me to continue as your marriage counselor. &nbsp;Without that, there&rsquo;s no way to reconcile.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you listening?&rdquo; I asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to reconcile. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m here about co-parenting. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not interested in reconciling&rdquo; &nbsp; She was adamant, refusing to consider my offer to tell Mary about the affair within a set number of sessions. &nbsp;She would refuse to continue unless I came clean immediately about the affair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I talked about it with Anya. &nbsp;She refused to let me share that I was having an affair, because she was afraid that Mary would come after her. &nbsp;And I was terrified of losing Anya, after losing Mary, and possibly the kids, and definitely Colleen, and who knew who else, though by this time it looked like I had also lost most of my friends in the book club.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I reluctantly canceled any further sessions with the counselor, having to tell Mary that based on my one-on-one conversation with her, I had lost trust in the counselor&rsquo;s ability to help us. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As this happened, we continued to speak with various therapists and advisors for the children about how we were managing their challenges and the separation. &nbsp; It seemed like each time Mary would pull out a surprising, damning statement about me. &nbsp; Afterwards, I would check in with her one on one to see if there was anything more, and she would say no, she&rsquo;d shared it all. &nbsp;Then the process would repeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;Each time something like that happened, I felt an agonizing tearing, like the bonds of commitment between me and Mary were ripped, painfully. &nbsp;I found my respect and remaining love for Mary taking immense hits. &nbsp;I realized that she was fighting in ways that I found unfair, manipulative, nasty. &nbsp; My image of her </span><span class="c9">took a nosedive.</span><span>&nbsp; I suddenly realized that she wasn&rsquo;t a friend attempting to make the best of a difficult situation. &nbsp;Instead, </span><span class="c9">she felt like </span><span class="c1">a deceitful and manipulative enemy, who would withhold damaging information until the most damaging possible moment, in front of professionals she believed would be supportive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Mary and I talked every few days about what was going on between us. &nbsp;I demanded that she take responsibility for part of the breakdown - to acknowledge that it takes two to make a relationship. &nbsp; Eventually one time, through gritted teeth, and obviously under duress, she acknowledged that her behaviour had some impact on the relationship. &nbsp;That she had some responsibility for its outcome. This was the first and only time I remember her admitting that. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She immediately turned back to the attack: &nbsp; &ldquo;You have a problem relating to people,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;You have no filter. &nbsp;And you have no idea the impact what you say and do will have on people. &nbsp;I think this is something wrong with you. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no way you can figure this out. You are deficient.&rdquo; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Deficient</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;The word was chilling. &nbsp;Was I really as bad as that? &nbsp;Maybe I was. &nbsp;Maybe that&rsquo;s why everybody was mad at me. &nbsp;Maybe that&rsquo;s why everyone was distancing themselves from me. &nbsp; Maybe there was no hope for me, after all. &nbsp;Maybe I deserved what was happening to me. &nbsp; There was a pit in my gut, and I felt light headed. &nbsp; I left Mary, with the word &ldquo;deficient&rdquo; ringing in my ears. &nbsp;I was deficient. &nbsp;And I deserved what was happening to me. &nbsp;The loss of my home and my children and the people I cared about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The next few weeks were miserable. &nbsp; I started looking for a place to live. &nbsp;I worked in my office with the door closed each day, sneaking out to grab food. &nbsp;Each night I tossed and turned on the office sofa. &nbsp;I woke up extremely itchy, covered with mosquito bites, and sleep-deprived. &nbsp;After a while I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t mosquito bites: &nbsp;rather, one of Mary&rsquo;s cats had infested the sofa with fleas. &nbsp; I treated the sofa, but continued to wake up day after day with incredibly itchy welts all over my torso and legs, </span><span class="c9">until the infestation receded and the bites slowly healed.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; The itches were infuriating and demoralizing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At times I talked with Mary about my moving out. &nbsp; I told her clearly and repeatedly, that if I moved out, I doubted I would move back in, and checked if that was what she wanted. &nbsp; She confirmed that I must go. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started packing, sorting through my files, tossing what I could. &nbsp; Each new item provoked a fit of nostalgia. &nbsp;Tears flowed. &nbsp;I scratched myself, frantic with itching. &nbsp; I despaired of ever feeling good again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just before I moved out, Anya and I tried a new place to park the car and neck, a parking lot in the Don Valley, fairly late one evening. We shared a beer, and talked, and then she gave me a blow job over the stick shift in the car. &nbsp; As she finished and I was zipping up my fly, there was a sudden loud knocking at the car window, and a flashlight shone in brightly from the gloom. &nbsp; It was the Toronto Police: the parking area was closed after 10 pm. &nbsp;There were two cruisers parked across the parking area, and three more cops were looking us over from across the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cops, seeing an empty beer can that I had poorly hidden behind my seat, made Anya, the driver, pissed as hell, do a breathalyzer test. &nbsp; Then they let us off with a citation. &nbsp; That was the last time I had sex in a car.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Eventually, on August 1, 2013, three years to the day from when I started life drawing, I moved out. &nbsp; I hired some movers and moved my stuff, a small fraction of what I left behind, a couple of blocks down the street to my new loft apartment, overlooking downtown Toronto, with prominent views of the CN tower. </span><span class="c18 c9">&nbsp;(Later, I set up my telescope and watched orange-jumpsuited tourists flailing in terror outside the observation pod on the Sky Walk attraction. &nbsp;Even from several kilometers away it was easy to pick out the leader based on their calm body language.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a day of moving and a small amount of unpacking, I sent Anya home so I could be alone. &nbsp;I put some old vinyl on the turntable (&ldquo;Room with a View&rdquo; and &ldquo;Every Word Means No&rdquo; by Let&rsquo;s Active, both of which seemed apposite), cranked up the volume, opened a nice bottle of red wine, and put on a steak to sear. &nbsp; &nbsp;As the tunes spun, the steak dinner went down, and the bottle emptied, I realized something absolutely, completely &nbsp;shocking: &nbsp; I was happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the first time in many weeks if not months, I was deliriously happy. &nbsp;I stared at the beautiful view of the city, listened to the music blasting, music that I hadn&rsquo;t played for years, drank wine, danced a little, and realized that life could maybe be good after marriage. &nbsp;I felt relieved, and safe, and comfortable, for the first time in a long time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things continued beautifully for weeks. &nbsp;Anya came over three or four nights a week, and we finally had the chance to fuck in a bed &hellip; for hours and hours. &nbsp;I started counting the number of times I rang her bell &hellip; we&rsquo;d often get up to six or seven before she&rsquo;d beg off, feeling overwhelmed. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d head home well after 1 am and I&rsquo;d toss myself into bed, knowing that I would have an intense work call the following morning at 8:30 or 9 am.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The spell broke towards the end of August. &nbsp; Brad was at jazz camp way up north, and he was going to be playing in a big concert. &nbsp; It made sense to me to offer Mary a drive, and she accepted. &nbsp;I thought we could talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We drove for hours. &nbsp; Now and then, maybe a couple of times an hour, one of us would point out some basic landmark - &ldquo;We need to turn here,&rdquo; for instance, or, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gas station, do you need to stop?&rdquo; &nbsp; Otherwise, not a word was spoken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I drove with Mary beside me, I wracked my brain for something to say, a conversational gambit, an opener. &nbsp;Nothing came to me. &nbsp;There was a heaviness, a blankness, coming from the passenger seat of the car, like there was a heavy, impenetrable blanket wrapped around her. &nbsp; I thought and I thought and I thought of what to say. &nbsp;Every now and then I cleared my throat &hellip;. And I didn&rsquo;t say anything. &nbsp; Eventually I just gave up, realizing that the gap between us was too big. &nbsp;That I didn&rsquo;t know how to begin to reconnect. &nbsp;And that she had no desire to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The concert was good </span><span class="c9">- there was a wonderful rendition of Cantaloupe Island by Herbie Hancock, played beautifully by the youth jazz band - </span><span class="c1">but the trip home was similar to the trip up, but worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the trip, I headed to my room, and lay on my bed, and confronted the realities of life: I had lost connection with many of the most important people in my life, and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. &nbsp;I fell into a pit of despair. Tears flowed. &nbsp;I lay, completely inert, staring at the ceiling, a searing pain in my chest. &nbsp;I finally understood why people kill themselves. &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t ready to do that, but I got it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That last bit, the understanding why people kill themselves, well, that jarred me. &nbsp;In fact, it terrified me. &nbsp;I realized that I had hit rock bottom, and I needed to do something, before I was ready to actually do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I continued to bounce around rock bottom, interspersed with periods of joy, over the coming months. &nbsp;Mary and I started a new round of relationship counseling with a new counselor. &nbsp;This one seemed to start out better, with a clear focus on improving communication.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By about the third session, Mary was feeling a bit more open. &nbsp; The therapist asked her to tell about how she had felt about the marriage, what came up for her. &nbsp; She launched into a 10 or 15 minute long monologue about the past 15 years or so. &nbsp; At some point, part way into it, she described me as having been violent and angry at times. &nbsp;And there was truth to this. &nbsp; But then she described me, through tears, as having sexually assaulted her during the dark times in the Poconos. &nbsp;Then after a moment she walked it back a little, and said, well, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t assault, but it felt like it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was stunned, confused, not sure what to think. &nbsp;This was something that she&rsquo;d never hinted to in our whole marriage. &nbsp;And the fact that she was crying when she said it was incredibly confusing. &nbsp;Mary was not a person to cry. &nbsp; She had gone years in our marriage without my having seen her shed a tear. &nbsp; Was this another performance she&rsquo;d trotted out for a third party, to damage me? &nbsp;Or was it real? &nbsp;Had she really felt this, or what she just saying it to score points? &nbsp; I felt like I no longer knew this woman, that I had no way of assessing the truth of what she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>There was more in the monologue, much more about my failings. &nbsp; &nbsp;My brain was whirling. &nbsp;Was this what Mary really felt, or was it an act, put on for the therapist, to damage me, to seek support? &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know how to think about this. &nbsp;</span><span>I didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt153" id="cmnt_ref153">[ew]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>Mary came to the end of her monologue, and the therapist asked me what I thought about it. &nbsp; I told the truth, as much as I could articulate it: &nbsp;I was surprised, stunned by what I had heard. </span><span class="c9">&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know</span><span>&nbsp;what to make of it, it was so different from what I&rsquo;d heard before. &nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s demeanor was unfamiliar, and</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know how</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to take it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>The therapist showed that she completely believed everything that Mary said. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt154" id="cmnt_ref154">[ex]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp; She raised the point about the &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo;, that wasn&rsquo;t really a sexual assault. &nbsp; She asked me how I felt about that. &nbsp; I told her it was the first I had heard anything of this, and that it was hard to process. &nbsp;That she had never mentioned anything of the sort in the previous 12 years or so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said, &ldquo;But look at how distressed it caused Mary to be. &nbsp; Do you acknowledge having caused Mary this distress?&rdquo; &nbsp; I told her that I couldn&rsquo;t even understand what Mary had said, that it was so out of sync with my understanding of what had happened. &nbsp;That until I had a coherent, credible picture of what I was supposed to have done, and until I could trust Mary&rsquo;s rendition of what had happened, it was premature for me to take responsibility for anything. &nbsp;That it felt like an unproven accusation. &nbsp;I said I wasn&rsquo;t ready to take this kind of responsibility, not yet.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>She continued. &nbsp;&ldquo;You know, our therapy can&rsquo;t continue to progress until you take responsibility for the impact you had on Mary.&rdquo; &nbsp; I became more strident in arguing my position: &nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t take responsibility for something until I believed it, and I didn&rsquo;t yet believe it. &nbsp;Mary&rsquo;s account did not seem honest and truthful to me. &nbsp;It was </span><span>inconsistent </span><sup><a href="#cmnt155" id="cmnt_ref155">[ey]</a></sup><span class="c1">with her previous behavior for the past several decades, and seemed to have been calculated to impress the therapist with my evilness. &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t take the blame for something that did not feel real. &nbsp;I needed time, to come to believe her, until I could do that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The therapist quickly intervened: &nbsp; &ldquo;Do you notice how your voice is rising? &nbsp;How you are becoming angry and defensive? &nbsp;You need to be aware of the impact your anger is having on the people in the room!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was suddenly a small child again, once again castigated for being too angry, for not being good at managing my feelings. &nbsp;I felt how unfair it was, that Mary&rsquo;s horrific, tear-filled account of me, filled with judgment, &nbsp;which had left me reeling, was ok. &nbsp;The impact that it had had on me was not worthy of consideration. &nbsp;I would just need to soldier on. &nbsp;But my attempt to give myself time to come to grips with it was rejected repeatedly until I became angry, and then I was punished for my anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once again I had the image of the toreador: &nbsp;the therapist had waved the red cloth at me until I had got angry and charged, and then had skillfully evaded me and stabbed me in the side as I lumbered by. &nbsp; I felt that I had failed, and I was terrified that couples therapy would fail and I would not be able to reconnect with the kids, whom I&rsquo;d seen only a little the previous weeks: Juliet refused to answer my messages, and Brad would sometimes come by my new place for an hour or two, and then wouldn&rsquo;t answer any messages for days or weeks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, outside of couples&rsquo; therapy, my relationship with Anya was having ups and downs. &nbsp;Things would progress well for a few days, maybe even a week or two, with us spending many long evenings together (never overnight), and then Anya would blow up, feeling overwhelmed, and disappear. &nbsp; &nbsp;I would be terrified of losing her, but also upset at some of the things she said. &nbsp;We would exchange long, angry emails trying to sort things out, but just making things worse. &nbsp;But eventually we would reconnect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of these breaks where I wasn&rsquo;t sure if we were still together happened just before Thanksgiving. &nbsp; I went to a Thanksgiving dinner at my cousin&rsquo;s, with around 15 of her friends and family. &nbsp; Everybody was talking loudly, happy and connected. &nbsp; And I felt so alone - like everyone else had friends, but not me. &nbsp;At the verge of tears, I excused myself and went home. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That break with Anya, like so many others to come, healed itself over the coming days. &nbsp;The pattern was always similar. &nbsp;Anya would come over, just to talk, about how we ended up breaking up, once again. &nbsp;She would sit across from me in my little living room area, her on a chair and me on the sofa, and vent her spleen at me, telling me about how I had failed at being a good partner - how I had been planning to leave her, how I&rsquo;d been too demanding, whatever. &nbsp;And I would listen, a hangdog expression on my face, and apologize when it seemed necessary. &nbsp; Eventually, after an hour or two of this, feeling emptied out of her fear and anger, she would clamber over to me and sit on my lap, and hug me, and go &ldquo;Ohhh, Bobby, how did we get to this point?&rdquo; &nbsp; Then within a few minutes we would be naked in bed, my mouth on her pussy&hellip;. Back together once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later that fall, a bigger series of uncertainty broke out. &nbsp;It transpired that Anya&rsquo;s husband, Jon, a day trading investment manager and gold bug, had managed to lose the vast majority of their nest egg, not to mention the much larger investments of his main client and best friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anya was livid at Jon and frightened for her future. &nbsp; She told me that she was going to tell Jon to leave, to get a small rented apartment. &nbsp; And that she wanted me to move in with her. &nbsp;She would make space for me in her home, and make it so I felt comfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This sudden change was surprising and exciting and scary. &nbsp; I suggested that I could keep my loft for a while - maybe a year - as an office and workspace, while we made sure that the new arrangement would work for us. &nbsp;I could afford to pay rent for both places for a time. &nbsp;I thought this would give us some space in case there were any teething troubles with the new arrangement. &nbsp;Her home and my office were close enough that this would make a comfortable commute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anya was not as receptive to this idea as I expected. &nbsp;In fact, quite the opposite: &nbsp;She was upset that I had my doubts that it would be smooth sailing. &nbsp;Something that she told me in no uncertain terms. &nbsp; And after some high volume discussion of my willingness to move in with her, she rescinded her offer, to my chagrin. &nbsp;(She never did ask Jon to leave, though it was a near run thing.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span>This oscillating pattern continued. &nbsp;I tried to provide stability by proposing that </span><span>I would swear a vow of commitment to her (and her the same to me)</span><sup><a href="#cmnt156" id="cmnt_ref156">[ez]</a></sup><span class="c1">. &nbsp;This freaked Anya out, making things worse than before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Come February 2014, for my 50th birthday, we took a trip together to Ottawa, sharing a suite with another couple, friends - Marjorie was an old friend of Anya&rsquo;s from Ottawa, and Ken was her illicit lover from the US. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d all met a few months back and things had clicked, and there was some curiosity about possibly playing together somehow. &nbsp; &nbsp;And even more exciting, It was the first time Anya and I had spent a full night together, the first time we&rsquo;d shared a breakfast coffee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Ottawa was frigid, as it tended to be at that time of year, -18C or so. &nbsp; One night we did a four way massage exchange, which seemed very daring and exciting at the time,</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;but now seems rather tame.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; We also headed to a nordic style spa in the Gatineau hills for a day. &nbsp;At one point we were all in the &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; pool - signs were up everywhere imploring patrons not to talk. &nbsp;And Anya was giggling and starting loud conversations with us and with others, and hugging us all ostentatiously.. &nbsp;Marjorie and I shushed her, trying to avoid a scene with the omnipresent spa staff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anya tootled off across the pool in a huff, not liking being shushed. &nbsp;Marjorie and I conferred, quietly, wondering what we did wrong, and how to calm Anya down, and how to restore good relations. &nbsp;We were worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was in vain. &nbsp;Anya refused to speak more than a few words to us for the rest of the visit to the spa. &nbsp;The ride home to the hotel was tense, in silence. &nbsp;Anya sat with her arms crossed, glaring out the window of the car.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the hotel, after a long, stony silence, Anya finally broke out: &nbsp; Marjorie and I were conspiring against her, she yelled. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d been laughing at her, and plotting together. She felt controlled and humiliated. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t want to be around people like that&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tirade continued for a long while, until it petered out. &nbsp;Eventually, the four of us managed to get back together into some sense of civility. &nbsp; But something in our relationship had changed. &nbsp; Anya had decided that she wanted more distance from me, that I was too uptight for her. &nbsp;And I had decided that I couldn&rsquo;t go on like this. &nbsp;That if I wanted to be with Anya, I had to learn to be more chill around people, to be more relaxed, to connect better, to be more relaxed about things like hugging. &nbsp;To take what she did less personally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>That fight in Ottawa marked the climax of our relationship and a turning point, to be followed by a long, somewhat painful slide over the rest of the year.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt157" id="cmnt_ref157">[fa]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started talking about wanting to explore other relationships, and about polyamory. &nbsp; Anya threatened to walk out, and I, after some deliberation, decided to keep with her. &nbsp; We fought. &nbsp;She took things home that she had left in my apartment. &nbsp; We made up. She brought a few things back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That spring, I learned about the Human Connection Institute, a group that promised to teach about love, sexuality, and intimacy. &nbsp; While it looked a little culty, I checked and it seemed it wasn&rsquo;t actually a cult, just a close-knit organization. &nbsp; &nbsp;And that it taught skills, like emotional connection and communication and consent, that could be helpful for polyamory. &nbsp;I decided to take a weekend-long, clothing optional workshop in August.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anya was nervous about this. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d been experimenting with sexy massage exchanges with a hunky guy, a model she&rsquo;d met through life drawing, but she wasn&rsquo;t ready to give up on me, and we continued to spend a lot of evenings together. &nbsp;She claimed that her sexy massages shouldn&rsquo;t bother me, but that if I went for dinner with another woman it was tantamount to cheating. &nbsp; We fought and made up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shortly before the HCI workshop, after having complained about it for months, Anya decided to join me at it. &nbsp;She wanted to see what it was all about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The HCI workshop was challenging. &nbsp;I was paired up with a buddy, a gawky man, and told to gaze in his eyes, and tell him intimate details of my life. &nbsp;And then, after we&rsquo;d all disrobed, I was told to stroke my buddy, all over the body - face and torso and arms and even legs. &nbsp;This was the first time I&rsquo;d touched a man like this and it was </span><span class="c9">stressful </span><span class="c1">and awkward, but I pushed through. &nbsp;Other exercises were a bit better, but I constantly found that it was hard to find partners for exercises, that I wasn&rsquo;t being picked for anything&hellip; &nbsp;Feelings of not being good enough kept coming up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the final, intense exercise, for which we needed groups of four, Anya had decided to pair up with a daunting Hungarian woman, a photographer, whom I&rsquo;d met briefly earlier in the workshop but had found distant. &nbsp;They pulled in another man, Carl. &nbsp; I was struggling, trying to figure out whether to ask Anya to join her group for the exercise, or to try to find another group. &nbsp;My prospects once again looked bleak. &nbsp;Then finally Anya grabbed me and asked me if I would join them. &nbsp;I think she thought she could keep an eye on me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The final exercise, in contrast to much of the rest of the workshop, was amazing. &nbsp;It was playful, funny, connective, sexy, and incredibly, wonderfully loving. &nbsp; By the end I found myself floating on a metaphorical cushion of appreciation, and more importantly lying naked next to Cassandra, the daunting Hungarian, also naked, whose body, it turned out, was absolutely spectacular. &nbsp;And she was snuggling against me! &nbsp; I felt that this high, and this intimate touch with this gorgeous woman, was a once in a lifetime experience. &nbsp;Never again, I thought, would I be next to - nay, touching - such a breathtaking woman&rsquo;s naked body. &nbsp;I felt like I had died and gone to heaven.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.og3buie7zkxw"><span class="c13">Chapter 16: Kink and Power</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s when you first met Cassandra?

&nbsp; Anya aggressively resisted all attempts to lighten things up. &nbsp;The atmosphere remained tense, but gradually softened a little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually we moved to the focus of our evening: &nbsp;a four-way massage exchange. &nbsp;Each of us would take a turn in the middle, while the others would massage them. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d set a timer and rotate. &nbsp;The receiver would express desires and set boundaries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was worried that Anya would continue to be disruptive, but she didn&rsquo;t: &nbsp;The massage exchange progressed smoothly, with everyone taking turns and enjoying receiving. &nbsp;It reminded me a little of the similar evening Anya and I had had in Ottawa, about six months earlier, but this was more sensual and more connective and a little more erotic, without being full on sexual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the massage exchange finished, I expected that we might all cuddle together, and something more sensual or erotic might emerge. &nbsp; But it didn&rsquo;t: &nbsp;Anya immediately fled to a corner, with a large &ldquo;do not touch&rdquo; energy field emanating from her. &nbsp;I tried to sit close to her, but the waves of disapproval eventually pushed me away. &nbsp; Cassandra was dancing sensually and randomly to some romantic music she was playing&hellip; I eventually moved over &nbsp;and danced near her. &nbsp;She gradually moved towards me, then pushed her back into me as we both slowly and sensually danced together. &nbsp;She pressed her bottom into my groin, and I encircled her waist and torso with my arms, and ran my hands over her body through the thin sheer fabric of her dress. &nbsp;At that moment I understood what it would feel like to make love to Cassandra. &nbsp;It was heady. &nbsp;It was heavenly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noticing Anya&rsquo;s discomfiture, and the lateness of the hour, I suggested that it was perhaps time to leave. &nbsp;Anya instantly agreed and leapt off the sofa. &nbsp; We quickly packed and left, murmuring thank yous to Cassandra and Karl, and got in the car without saying anything to each other. &nbsp;Once we were sitting in the car, I asked Anya if she wanted to talk. &nbsp;She just glared out the passenger side window, not saying a word. &nbsp; I decided to drive towards Anya&rsquo;s home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The drive home was completely silent. &nbsp;Every once in a while I looked over at Anya, and noticed no change in her tense, distant body language. &nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to bridge the gap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we approached Anya&rsquo;s house, she gestured to me to pull to a corner just short of her house, where she often got out, so her family wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see me drop her off. &nbsp;As I turned and slowed toward the sidewalk, she pulled the door open before the car came to a stop, hopped out, slammed the door, and hot footed it away towards her house. &nbsp;By the time I had stopped and gotten out, she was invisible, and I could hear her heading up the steps to her house. &nbsp; I headed home, confused, wondering what exactly had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next week I headed to New York City for a business trip. &nbsp;While I was there Cassandra wrote me a letter &hellip; but it didn&rsquo;t arrive, not at first. &nbsp; But she asked me about it. &nbsp; Puzzled, I wondered what was in it: &nbsp;she was reluctant to share, but hinted it was major: she&rsquo;d made a major declaration to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, on my return I got it: &nbsp;The letter read that she wanted to give herself to me, to do whatever I pleased, for a 24-hour period. &nbsp;She would be my sex slave. &nbsp;There was no limit to what I could do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Smitten with her and stunned by this proposal, I immediately went into an intense fantasy: &nbsp; I would strip her naked, and put a collar and leash on her, and parade her up and down the sidewalk in front of the Institue of Contemporary Photography in NYC, where she had recently completed a major project. &nbsp; I was thrilled and turned on and mesmerized by the prospect. &nbsp; But quickly another feeling arose: revulsion. &nbsp;Why would I want to do something like that? &nbsp;What was wrong with me? &nbsp;And another feeling: &nbsp;fear. &nbsp;Fear that if I did something like that, Cassandra, whose emotional balance seemed uneven, might snap. &nbsp;It might send her over the brink - and I would be the culprit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided I couldn&rsquo;t do it. &nbsp; I went into a long series of difficult conversations: &nbsp;On a long walk, I told Cassandra that I was refusing her offer, that I couldn&rsquo;t do what she asked, and that I was together with Anya. &nbsp;I told Anya, without specifics, that Cassandra had made me an offer, and that I had refused it, and that I was committed to her as my partner. &nbsp;Then, a few days later, Anya decided that she couldn&rsquo;t take it, the stress of seeing my interest in Cassandra. &nbsp;So she broke up with me, this time for good, it seemed. &nbsp; A couple of days later, while I was nursing my grief, she unexpectedly came over to my place to continue her harangue, spending six hours telling me all the reasons why she didn&rsquo;t want to be with me. &nbsp; Eventually, exhausted, she left, no reconciliation in sight, with me also exhausted, wondering what had happened, and why she had belabored the point, but really convinced that she had meant it this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all this, I contacted Cassandra and told her that Anya and I had broken up, and did she want to get together?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next night I visited Cassandra, and I ended up staying the night. &nbsp; We had a beautiful dinner that she made, and one thing led to another, and we kissed, and we made love, and &hellip;. Well, truth be told, making love didn&rsquo;t go as well as I hoped. &nbsp;Cassandra hated oral sex, either giving or receiving, and just wanted to be pounded. &nbsp;And I couldn&rsquo;t really do that without warmup&hellip; and I felt inadequate. &nbsp;I fretted that I didn&rsquo;t know how to please her, that I didn&rsquo;t have the right skills, that we weren&rsquo;t well matched. But our connection was lovely, and we made plans to meet again. &nbsp;Cassandra said not to worry: &nbsp;&ldquo;We have time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day Anya called me again, asking for a lift somewhere. &nbsp; I picked her up. &nbsp;She asked me what I had been doing. &nbsp;I told her that I&rsquo;d seen Cassandra, that I&rsquo;d stayed the night, that we&rsquo;d made plans to get together again. &nbsp; She looked unhappy but told me she understood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cassandra and I started seeing each other frequently. &nbsp;We went on a romantic canoe trip on a tiny, narrow stream, and ate a picnic, and she told me horrifying and bonding stories of her life, of some of the disasters that had befallen her. &nbsp;My heart opened to her as I learned about what she had had to deal with growing up. &nbsp; We took a bath together. &nbsp; I was in love. &nbsp; Sex continued to be a problem&hellip; relaxed by the bath, but terrified by the first time&rsquo;s poor showing, I had a hard time getting - well - hard, and the sex was once again disappointing&hellip; and I was terrified that Cassandra would give up on me, disappointed with the sex.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Somewhere along, Anya came back in the picture: &nbsp;She told me that was thinking that maybe she could continue to see me, even if I was seeing Cassandra. &nbsp;Maybe she could try this polyamory thing.. &nbsp; I talked to Cassandra, who said, sure - polyamory sounded fine to her. &nbsp;It turned out that her previous relationship had been polyamorous, and she was intrigued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This started a two and a half month shitshow of fighting and reconciliation, a triangle of desire and connection and conflict. &nbsp; I would get together with Anya, who would freak out at me, then I would head over to Cassandra, finding myself still vibrating from the last encounter, and unable to be present with her. &nbsp;At one point, as things between me and Cassandra were deteriorating, she suggested that we should get together for a walk and talk. &nbsp; I had a pit in my stomach: &nbsp;I knew that if we had that walk and talk, it would be the end: &nbsp;Cassandra would dump me. &nbsp; So I came up with a counterplan: &nbsp;I told Cassandra I would pick her up and take her for a drive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I arrived, I told Cassandra to put on a blindfold. &nbsp;Then I drove her around aimlessly in circles for an hour, doing my best to confuse her about where we were. &nbsp;Then I led her, still blindfolded, into a downtown hotel and up to the hotel room that I had previously prepared. &nbsp;Then I tied her to the bed, and had my way with her : spanking her, flogging her, using a glass dildo on her, making her taste unknown substances (it turned out that she hated ginger marmalade), using a vibrator on her. &nbsp;Her body responded delightfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time we eventually left the hotel room the next morning, leaving behind a few sex toys for the maids to discover, Cassandra was back in love. &nbsp;It had turned out that action sometimes trumps conversation for resolving relationship problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fall went on with its turmoil. &nbsp;From day to day I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether I was dating two, or one, or zero partners. &nbsp;The number seemed to fluctuate hourly at times. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In December I took a business trip to New York and invited Cassandra to come with me. &nbsp;Anya drove me to the airport, where I met Cassandra. &nbsp;Cassandra was clearly frosted with me, that I had let Anya do that, and barely spoke at first, but eventually calmed down. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our trip to NYC ended up being lovely, despite the difficult beginning, and terrible, rainy, cold weather: we visited museums together, I showed Cassandra where I had lived. &nbsp;We talked. We made love.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On our return to Toronto, Cassandra dumped me, leaving me bereft, feeling like I had failed at polyamory, that it was my fault. &nbsp; Then I almost immediately came down with a terrible flu. &nbsp; My Christmas Eve was one of the worst ever: sick, alone, grieving Cassandra. &nbsp;Cassandra and I exchanged angry, frustrated emails and texts every day or two. &nbsp;After Christmas, Anya came by to commiserate. &nbsp;Her message was simple: &nbsp;it was my own fault. &nbsp;I should have never started seeing Cassandra. &nbsp;I had brought it on myself. &nbsp;But she had me, and she would forgive me.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason I didn&rsquo;t find this kind of commiseration to be helpful. &nbsp;I realized that I didn&rsquo;t want to be with someone whose idea of helping me was to rub salt in my wounds. &nbsp;Who was more concerned with her own pain than at actually caring about what I felt. &nbsp;Who used my moment of weakness as a way to push herself forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We had made plans for Anya to stay over with me for New Year&rsquo;s Eve. &nbsp; It was a sad, difficult night. &nbsp;Every few minutes I texted Cassandra, who had gone out on a long cold walk with a friend. &nbsp;She told me that it was too painful, she needed to stop communicating with me. &nbsp;I told her I would stop, until there was some change. &nbsp; I watched a movie with Anya. &nbsp;We went to bed together, but didn&rsquo;t make love. &nbsp;In the morning she headed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I collected my thoughts for a while, and made my decision: &nbsp;I was done with Anya, no matter what happened with Cassandra. &nbsp; I wrote to Anya: &nbsp; I had decided to end it. &nbsp;We could talk if she liked. &nbsp;I also wrote to Cassandra: &nbsp; I told her that I&rsquo;d ended it with Anya, and asked if I could come to visit her to talk. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She invited me over to dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walking from the subway station to Cassandra&rsquo;s home that night, I found myself in a strange place: &nbsp;At a crossroads, not knowing where the conversation would go. &nbsp;Not knowing where I wanted it to go. &nbsp;Not sure if I wanted to subject myself to all of Cassandra&rsquo;s barbs about me, about how I wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;arrived&rdquo;, not a man enough for her. &nbsp;But also aware of how much she attracted me, despite all the conflict.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>That walk, on Jan. 1, 2015, was the first day of a nearly four year period where Cassandra and I were together, almost without interruption. &nbsp;We had frequent hiccups, and a few stretches of distance for a few weeks, but stayed together until nearly the end of 2018.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt158" id="cmnt_ref158">[fb]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During that time we did so much together: &nbsp;We traveled together, to Europe (Germany and Venice and Croatia), to Costa Rica, to Chicogo and Milwaukee, to Newfoundland, to the deserts of the US southwest. &nbsp; We ate together, and had our beautiful morning coffees. &nbsp;We sometimes collaborated on art projects. &nbsp; We talked about relationships. &nbsp;We experimented with relationship models and sometimes with psychedelic substances. &nbsp; And most of all, month in and month out, we did amazing, connective, sexy, bonding, creative kink.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would plan a kinky scene for days or weeks, imagining a new story or twist, a new rope tie, a new type of sensation, a new type of role play. &nbsp;I would get supplies. &nbsp;I would prepare my space. &nbsp;I would send Cassandra an email or text on the afternoon of the scene, and tell her how to dress, and what to prepare, and when to arrive. &nbsp; &nbsp;When she arrived at my place, I would be dressed in leather, or in a suit. &nbsp;I would be severe. &nbsp;We would do a transfer of power ritual, where she agreed to be my plaything. &nbsp; I would sometimes make her disrobe, and turn slowly around as I examined her. &nbsp;If I found anything wanting, or if she disobeyed, I would use my riding crop to correct her, with a swift tap on the behind. &nbsp; Often it would leave a little mark or bruise, as well as the memory of that sensation. &nbsp;Sometimes I would make her kneel on hands and knees as I rested my feet on her naked back, and drink a glass of Scotch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We&rsquo;d usually move to the bedroom next. &nbsp;I would tie her to my bed, equipped with rings attached to a heavy frame that I&rsquo;d made out of rough 4x4 lumber, and set her in a vulnerable position, often with her legs spread wide. &nbsp;I would spank her and flog her with a flogger until her ass was a shiny pink and she was highly aroused. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d ask me to fuck her, and I wouldn&rsquo;t. &nbsp; Eventually, I&rsquo;d use a vibrator on her to make her come, </span><span>still waiting for my cock inside her.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt159" id="cmnt_ref159">[fc]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once I&rsquo;d had enough of this, I&rsquo;d release her, and I&rsquo;d finally give her what she wanted: my cock in her. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d take my cock in my mouth until it was hard, then beg me to fuck her. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d shudder and vibrate, continuing to do so even after I was done fucking her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterwards, we&rsquo;d feel floating and connected and delirious. &nbsp;The feeling of connection would last a while, often many hours or even days, but sometimes things would shift: &nbsp;for instance, after Cassandra went home, I might have a difficult conversation with my lawyer about my separation. &nbsp;Then I&rsquo;d be in a different head space, and Cassandra would wonder why I wasn&rsquo;t feeling so connected some hours later, and would worry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some days later, we&rsquo;d talk about what had happened, what had worked, what we might want more of&hellip; And then I&rsquo;d make plans for the next scene. &nbsp;This time with a chain, or with a chastity belt, or with nipple clamps, or hot wax, or whatever. &nbsp; She&rsquo;d tell me that she didn&rsquo;t want a safeword, or for me to check in - that I should just do whatever I wanted. &nbsp; Then the next time we talked about a scene, she&rsquo;d complain that I hadn&rsquo;t pushed her hard enough - that she wanted more intensity. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d worry that I didn&rsquo;t know how far I could push her, or that I was gutsy enough to push her as far as she wanted, as far as another man might push her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>For a long time, I only ever did kink with Cassandra. &nbsp; Eventually, as I started seeing other women, I tried it with others, and discovered how different it could be: &nbsp;With others it could be fun, and sexy, and other easier than with Cassandra. &nbsp;Other women typically weren&rsquo;t as bratty and difficult as Cassandra. &nbsp;They were often clearer on their limits, so I could more easily push farther. &nbsp;On the other hand, other women mostly weren&rsquo;t nearly as fun as Cassandra. &nbsp; I learned that </span><span class="c24">sometimes </span><span class="c1">I enjoyed the challenge of having to guess, of not knowing exactly what my partner wanted, or what her limits were: and learning how to work that out by observing her, by imagining things based on hints she dropped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, I discovered that I enjoyed being a top or a dom (dominant) for an audience, showing off the connection between me and a bottom. &nbsp; This performance aspect increased the sense of power and pleasure of being in charge.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.z85ny9m41tc2"><span class="c13">Chapter 17: Art</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dan, sitting next to us by the fire, remarked, &ldquo;You always do it so well. &nbsp;I remember that first time we got together, at Bonanza - it was so fucking hot when you spanked and flogged Cassandra&rsquo;s ass, bent over the bed, then pulled her thong down so we could see her pussy. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d never seen anything like it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monica giggled appreciatively at the memory, squirming a little in her seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I continued my story.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After I started life drawing in 2011, I quickly fell in love with art, and decided that I wanted to make this my next career, as I wound down my technology career. &nbsp; I took a couple of art classes at &nbsp;Art School of Toronto, an art school oriented more towards continuing education and older students than to younger students wanting an arts education. &nbsp; The classes were interesting and good. &nbsp;The first class, a drawing class, reminded me of my art class at Harvard, covering similar topics and skills. &nbsp; My second class there, a life drawing class, was interesting, and was taught by a lovely, skilled teacher who subsequently went on to become a friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what really shifted things for me was coming across a flier for the Toronto Art Academy, a tiny traditional art school located way across down in the west end, close to the Junction. &nbsp; I visited the academy and saw their methods, which were entirely different from what I&rsquo;d seen at the AST.. &nbsp;Instead of a handful or two of students all at the same level, all studying the same material, all working at differing levels of middling skill, I saw a one room schoolhouse, with eight or ten or a dozen students all working away on individual projects. &nbsp; And all the projects, from beginner to master, struck me as having outstanding quality: &nbsp;The drawings and paintings were highly skilled, with accurate proportions and wonderful representation. &nbsp;There were wonderful master copies of drawings and paintings, and excellent original works - still lives and figure drawings and paintings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wanted to draw and paint like that, with skill and precision. &nbsp; I booked a one day a week class to get familiar, learning that I could ramp up incrementally to full time if I wished. &nbsp; At the first class, I had to trace a fuzzy image, a small, blurry photocopy of a cast drawing, and mark on the tracing paper the areas that were in the darks and the lights. &nbsp; This apparently simple task was surprisingly challenging, but I quickly got to it. &nbsp;When I had completed the work after 15 or 20 minutes, and reviewed it, and reviewed it again, I would wait for a master to come by to sign off and let me move to the next assignment. &nbsp; &nbsp;And would wait. Eventually the master would come by. &nbsp;He would look at it, ponder it for a few moments, and say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good start. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure that we can get that into shape within another class or two.&rdquo; &nbsp; My heart sank. &nbsp;Each class was 3 or 4 hours long.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the hallmark of all the work I did there. &nbsp;I would work my hardest, and do the very best work I could, using all the skills and techniques I had learned there. &nbsp;Skills like alignment, and measuring proportion with a stick, and squinting, and using &ldquo;creatures&rdquo; to defamiliarize shapes, and so on and so on and so on. &nbsp;Then I would sit back and review my work all the ways I could, all the ways that I learned, to make sure it was the very best that I could do. &nbsp; I&rsquo;d leave the room for a few minutes and come back to see what it looked like. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d turn it upside down or sideways. &nbsp;I might even check with another student for comments. &nbsp; Then after an hour or two or more of review and fixes and refinement, I would finally decide that it was perfect, that no problems remained. &nbsp;That the master would find absolutely not a single flaw. &nbsp; Then the master would come by, study it for 10 or 15 seconds, and say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great start.&rdquo; &nbsp;Then launch into a thorough and detailed review of all of the many problems that he saw, just to get it into shape for the refinement stage, at which he would have more to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the wonderful thing was that I could see my skills growing. &nbsp;My rapid sketches at my weekly life drawing group rapidly improved as I learned to apply the meticulous, slow-moving skills I had learned at the TAA in a much more rapid-paced setting. &nbsp;I found myself checking alignments automatically as I drew one or two minute sketches. &nbsp;I noticed that when I drew quick figure sketches in pen, when I got back to where I had started, the lines would often connect properly, instead of being completely out of sync. &nbsp;Things just looked better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I continued to study at TAA for several years. &nbsp; I studied drawing skills, in the process learning about value, and even shading, and line quality, and bedbug lines, and shadow types, and many, many other </span><span class="c9">things</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;I drew many copies of cast drawings originally developed by Charles Bargue: &nbsp;I learned that this was a standard way to teach drawing at traditionalist art academies, which I learned had sprung up all over the world. &nbsp;I started learning painting fundamentals, like how to mix paints to create colour charts, controlling value (darkness) and hue (colour) and chroma (saturation). &nbsp;To my surprise, I learned that getting chroma right was critical to an accurate representation - I&rsquo;d never even come across that idea in my previous art studies. &nbsp;I did numerous studies where I attempted to reproduce the colours of a master painting, where in each case I needed to limit the number of colours to a small handful, coming up with some kind of average colour for some areas with what appeared to my untrained eye to be wildly different. &nbsp; It was a mind-bending exercise - but I could see the results the more experienced students were getting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile my marriage dissolved and my relationship with Anya was complicated. &nbsp; I continued at TAA off and on, taking a leave for a while after I realized that my separation was making it hard for me to focus, then coming back for another round to complete my Level 1 studies there, which were the basics to get ready for real painting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I started seeing Cassandra, my art studies became a little fraught. &nbsp;I was pleased with how my skills were improving, but Cassandra was not impressed. &nbsp;She was a conceptual photographer, steeped in contemporary training, and was contemptuous about things like academic drawing skill and traditional representational painting. &nbsp; She sneered at my work, embarrassed that her art world colleagues might see it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One night we were eating dinner at a restaurant on the Danforth. &nbsp; I made some comment in which I described myself as &ldquo;an artist&rdquo;. &nbsp;Cassandra immediately took umbrage: &nbsp;&ldquo;You, an artist???&rdquo; she questioned, in a loud, penetrating voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some nearby diners glanced towards our table. &nbsp;Cassandra continued: &nbsp;&ldquo;You have no right to call yourself an artist! &nbsp; An artist puts a lifetime into art, and creates a body of work. &nbsp;An artist puts everything aside to work on their art! &nbsp;An artist will live in an attic, starving themselves, to do their art. &nbsp;For an artist, art isn&rsquo;t a choice, it&rsquo;s a necessity. &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t have the guts to be an artist. &nbsp;You took a cushy job. &nbsp;You have no body of work. &nbsp;You are playing at being an artist, but you will never be an artist!!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the last words rang out through the restaurant, a few diners at a couple of nearby tables got up and moved farther away. &nbsp; I sat there, abashed, weakly trying to defend myself. &nbsp;I stammered that I didn&rsquo;t mean that I was a professional artist, just that I was doing art. &nbsp; I thought to myself that it was easy to say for Cassandra, who had been supported for 25 years by her ex-husband as she developed her photography practice, that I should have devoted my life to art, but that I didn&rsquo;t have the financial means to take on this kind of romantic quest earlier in my life. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the conflict with Cassandra was enriching. &nbsp;I learned more about contemporary art and photography, and I decided that maybe there was something to it, something that I could learn from. &nbsp;We visited photography and contemporary shows together, and talked about the differences between traditional and contemporary art practices. &nbsp;How contemporary art valued innovation and critique above all else, while traditional art valued skill and derided innovation without skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, I decided that I wanted to learn more about contemporary art. &nbsp;I signed up for a 10 day contemporary art residency at &ldquo;Naked Acres&rdquo;, a nudist colony (or, as I learned to say, &ldquo;naturist resort&rdquo;) located forty minutes north of Toronto. &nbsp;I thought I could do my figure sketching with residents and visitors at the facility, while being surrounded by contemporary artists. &nbsp;It seemed perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Nude and Free&rdquo; &nbsp;art residency didn&rsquo;t go as I expected. &nbsp;When I arrived, I was asked to sit through an indoctrination video that explained that it was important to be as naked as possible at all times - that if I got cold, I should put a shirt on first, and only put on pants as a last resort. &nbsp;This seemed slightly heavy handed but ok. &nbsp;Then it made a big deal that there should be nothing vaguely erotic happening in public. &nbsp;Seemed reasonable, but it also felt heavy handed. &nbsp;Then after I made it in to the camp and started unloading things, I got told off for briefly parking in an empty driveway to unload some heavy boxes. &nbsp;Then later for not having a parking permit (no one had told me I needed one). &nbsp; Each interaction seemed rigid and unpleasant, the opposite of playful and relaxed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time I got settled in, I was feeling closed off and uncomfortable. &nbsp;Then I met my fellow artists: &nbsp;they were a group of artists of various ages, but the largest contingent was four young, beautiful, and very feminist artists. &nbsp;They made it clear that I wasn&rsquo;t welcome to join them in as they went off and started working, because they were dismantling the patriarchy. &nbsp; The other artists were mostly either much older than I, or ardent feminists who seemed to make it clear that men were unwelcome. &nbsp; At least I liked the leader, who was a little ditzy and vague, but who cared about her artists and worked tirelessly to get them what they needed. &nbsp;But I felt disconnected, alone, and unclear what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the week went on, I found that I had no interest in drawing people. &nbsp;I feared that asking them to pose for me would be considered too forward (would that be considered erotic?), and I didn&rsquo;t like the vibe that I felt at the camp. &nbsp; So I started painting, of all things, a large landscape. &nbsp;As the week went on, I started seeing what the other artists were doing, and being intrigued by some of them. &nbsp; One of the artists, an ardent, angry feminist, inventor of the &ldquo;male nipple pasty&rdquo; internet meme, read brief quotations about sexual assault and menstruation and breast reduction and misogyny over the camp PA system. &nbsp;I found myself admiring her chutzpah, even though I didn&rsquo;t find her particularly friendly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another artist I admired was a young woman who filmed videos of the other artists swimming alone in the pool while being interviewed about their first experience of being naked. &nbsp;I found the vulnerability of the resulting shares intriguing. The artist whom I most admired, and eventually found myself crushing on, was a gay Mormon from out West who was putting together a compelling and horrifying experimental play about his experiences with conversion therapy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile pressures built up. &nbsp;I tried checking in with Cassandra, who took a very long time to respond to my messages. &nbsp;When she eventually answered, it was with tales of going to Toronto Island for long walks on the beach with her yoga teacher, a woman she&rsquo;d been crushing on since I&rsquo;d met her. &nbsp;I imagined them necking on the beach, and felt very alone. &nbsp; I got into conflict with one of the artists, a woman relatively close to my age&hellip; I&rsquo;d been complaining about feeling alone and left out, and she let slip some kind of remark that I deserved it. &nbsp;I got angry and tossed something into the fire and stormed off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the last couple of days of the residency, I was fed up. &nbsp; On the second last day I asked one of the artists to photograph me as I did something: &nbsp;I picked up the large landscape painting I was working on, and a cigarette lighter, and swam with them held over my head out to the middle of the large pond, and climbed up onto the floating dock. &nbsp;Then I attempted to set the painting on fire, not realizing that it wasn&rsquo;t so easy to do that. &nbsp;I managed to scorch it a little and burn my fingers. &nbsp;Then, furious, I swam back to shore with the painting, pulled out my Exacto knife, and slit it with a large number of vaguely parallel cuts. &nbsp;Then, still in a state of fury, I did the same with another crude painting I&rsquo;d done, I wove the resulting strips of canvas together into a basket weave. &nbsp;It was an angry, sarcastic gibe at some of the contemporary art works I was seeing - a crude parody, done in frustration, intentionally ugly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day was the last full day of the residency, where we showed our results and critiqued each other. &nbsp;Still fuming, I walked around the camp with a large red circle with a cross through it, like a &ldquo;do not turn&rdquo; traffic sign, emblazoned with body paint over my genitals. &nbsp;No one remarked on it, though I caught sight of a couple of ladies snickering in the distance. &nbsp; When it was time for my critique, most of the other artists who commented on my work remarked at what a great leap I&rsquo;d made with my art, and how amazing it was. &nbsp;I was stunned, wondering how they could not see that this was a bad joke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Heading home after the camp, I pondered what I&rsquo;d learned. &nbsp;I decided to ignore what I saw as bullshit, and focus on the cool, inspiring ideas that I&rsquo;d seen. &nbsp;This was the genesis of a project I called &ldquo;21st Century Loving&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I realized that in my real life I was curious about things that didn&rsquo;t show up much in my art. &nbsp;I was interested in different models of relationship, like polyamory, and that I wanted my art to reflect that. &nbsp;And I was inspired by the artists who&rsquo;d done the little documentary video.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided I would do a project on people and relationships. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d interview a variety of people, of different backgrounds and experience, about their relationship models. &nbsp; I&rsquo;d put it together into some kind of documentary film, addressing things like non-monogamy and jealousy and relationship conflict. &nbsp;Then I&rsquo;d use that work as inspiration for something else - I wasn&rsquo;t sure what, but some kind of studio work. &nbsp;Eventually, I imagined, I would organize some kind of activist event. &nbsp;I imagined a kiss-in at a downtown square: &nbsp; A man and a woman would kiss, passionately, in a public display of affection. &nbsp;Then a woman would break in, and start kissing the woman, as the man walked off, relaxed. &nbsp;Then another man would approach, and start kissing one of the women. &nbsp; And so on, and so on, with a variety of men and women kissing. &nbsp;I imagined filming the event, and the reactions of passersby, as they realized what was happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The activist event never happened, but the interviews did&hellip; I ended up interviewing about eight people, all of whom had some exposure to polyamory, asking them each a number of questions about their experiences. &nbsp;Then I worked on editing these interviews together. &nbsp; I found that the editing process was challenging, particularly working with some footage and sound quality that was less than ideal. &nbsp;But eventually I had some work done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then I invited three models I recruited through a polyamory dating group to come and visit me in my studio. &nbsp;I filmed and photographed them as they danced together. &nbsp; It was fun, and we made plans to do it again. &nbsp;The second time I took some photos that I intended to use as reference photos for some paintings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The resulting images led me to do a series of paintings I called the &ldquo;Trio&rdquo; series: &nbsp;of three nude models, apparently of a black man and two women, connecting happily and sensuously. &nbsp; I saw the art as sensual but not sexual. &nbsp;I spent most of a year working on those paintings, and on editing video together into a long, experimental documentary on how they approached relationships. &nbsp; Eventually I held a studio show for a few dozen friends and members of the polyamorous community, showing the paintings and videos. &nbsp;I also showed the paintings and some photos at an open air art show at a park, attracting curious gawkers and haters. &nbsp; I enjoyed some of the reactions. &nbsp;At the art fair in the park, one man dragged his young son away, saying &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at that terrible stuff!&rdquo; &nbsp;And then he muttered under his breath, &ldquo;But it sure is done well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That series became known as the &ldquo;Threesome&rdquo; series by the people who saw it. &nbsp;No one saw it as people connecting sensually: &nbsp;everyone saw it as a record of a threesome. &nbsp;Which I found interesting, because there was no actual sexual activity at either of the studio sessions&hellip; yes, some playful sensuality, but nothing overtly sexual the whole time. &nbsp;I found it fascinating that people assumed that sex was happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While I was happy with the reactions, I was less so with the success of the work as a commercial project. &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to sell a lot of paintings, but I hoped to sell some smaller and cheaper prints, or some even some postcards or t-shirts. &nbsp; I did sell one or two very small prints to friends, but nothing else, not even postcards for $3. &nbsp;I realized that this work, while polarizing and engaging, wasn&rsquo;t something that people wanted around. &nbsp; Disappointed, I wondered what to do next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Over the coming years I continued to wonder about this. &nbsp;I would stop painting for a while, then eventually get back to it with a new idea: &nbsp; A short series of paintings of hands touching bodies. &nbsp; Then a longer series of multi-image portraits: &nbsp;portraits of a model in costume showing multiple expressions, things like excitement and anger and joy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But somehow the idea that I would make a second career of art came off the rails. &nbsp;I realized that I had neither the need nor the desire to make a commercial success of my art, that I would rather continue to do it for fun than to treat it as seriously as I had once treated my software technology career. &nbsp; My success in technology and business on Wall Street &nbsp;meant that I didn&#39;t need to make the sacrifice I would need to to have &ldquo;success&rdquo; in art. &nbsp; But questions kept coming up about how and why to approach my art.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c17" id="h.o6396gtm9df1"><span class="c13">Chapter 18: Polyamory</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jack and Cassandra called us over for dinner. &nbsp;Dan poured wine and Monica bustled about, putting food out, arranging place settings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After we had eaten, Cassandra commented, &ldquo;I know a few of our guests are curious about our experiments with polyamory. &nbsp;Why don&rsquo;t you tell them about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I poured myself another glass of wine, as I </span><span class="c9">pondered </span><span class="c1">where to begin.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the failed experiment with Anya and Cassandra in the fall of 2014, when I got back together with Cassandra we decided to close our relationship, at least at first. &nbsp;We decided to undertake &ldquo;intentional monogamy&rdquo;, where the decision to be monogamous was made consciously, with intention, rather than by default. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought our monogamous phase would be brief &hellip; perhaps six weeks, perhaps a few months. &nbsp;But it turned out to last for quite some time, well over a year. &nbsp; Cassandra was doing a project that took her to Europe frequently for several weeks at a time. &nbsp;Each time this put some pressure on our relationship: &nbsp;I often felt lonely, and wishing for other connection; I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of other friends, and found myself alone a lot of the time when she was away, unless I went out to an event. &nbsp;But we made a practice of writing each other long emails each day or so, and found that our connection continued strong. &nbsp;I was going out to events where I met other people and learned about relating, but I was not seeking other relationships. &nbsp;We were both enjoying this focus on each other, even though we agreed that eventually we&rsquo;d open our relationship again - once we felt secure enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the spring of 2016, as Cassandra&rsquo;s art project intensified and she started spending even more time in Europe, and less time with me when she was in Toronto, I started asking the question about whether it was time to open our relationship again, not completely clear in my own mind about what I wanted. &nbsp; &nbsp;But one Saturday morning in bed, feeling bonded after an intense kinky scene the night before, and shortly before heading off on a long trip to Europe, Cassandra raised the topic again: &nbsp; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time to open our relationship, so we can see other people,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was surprised. &nbsp; Did she really mean this? &nbsp;It was certainly something I&rsquo;d been thinking about, but I hadn&rsquo;t really thought of this happening right away. &nbsp; It felt exciting, and maybe a bit scary. &nbsp; We talked for a long time about what it would mean, and how it might work. &nbsp;Cassandra mentioned that she was intrigued by Taylor, her yoga teacher, and that she might in time want to get closer to her. &nbsp; I had no one in mind, but I was intrigued by the idea of meeting people at various polyamory meetup events, or online through dating apps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Cassandra left, I excitedly began creating an online dating profile. &nbsp;In it, I emphasized that I was polyamorous and in an existing relationship; it felt important to make this clear to prospective dating partners. &nbsp; I was turned on and excited. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that night, my feelings shifted. &nbsp; I fell into a well of grief. &nbsp;Opening the relationship started to feel like a loss: &nbsp;the sense of specialness, the sense of commitment that we&rsquo;d had the last year or more, was gone. &nbsp; We were now just people who were dating, not partners who were committed to each other. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d lost something, and it wasn&rsquo;t clear if we&rsquo;d gained anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This rapid shifting of feelings, from excitement and joy to fear to grief, foreshadowed how the experiment with polyamory would go: &nbsp; the next several years were an emotional roller coaster, with some of the best times I&rsquo;d ever experienced in my life, along with some of the most challenging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Cassandra headed off to Europe, I started tentatively going on a few dates with women I&rsquo;d met online. &nbsp;It was a funny time. &nbsp;I went to dinner with a university professor of anthropology who was writing a book based on her ethnographic studies in Nunavut. &nbsp;The dinner stretched on for hours and hours, at least four. &nbsp;The chemistry of the conversation was amazing&hellip; we couldn&rsquo;t tear ourselves apart. &nbsp;Then when it was time to go, she made it clear that she wanted to go home herself, but she accompanied me to my bicycle. &nbsp;As we were about to part, I started to move to give her a goodbye hug, a gesture which by this time had to feel to me about as innocuous as a handshake. &nbsp;But as my arms started to encircle her, it was like a force field had suddenly emanated from her body, and flung my arms apart, and the hug vanished. &nbsp; I was stunned: &nbsp;After a four hour, intense, animated conversation on an explicit date, she wasn&rsquo;t open even to a &nbsp;companionable hug? &nbsp;It felt like a stunning rejection, or it would have if I&rsquo;d been self-aware enough to understand what was going on for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I followed up on that date with an angry email to her, to my subsequent chagrin and embarrassment. &nbsp; Why had I found it necessary to compound this woman&rsquo;s obvious fear of physical intimacy with harassment? &nbsp;We maintained a correspondence for a while, but that was it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another woman, a tough sexy lawyer, was even more interesting and confusing to date. &nbsp; We agreed to meet in a public park - her suggestion, as she wanted to make sure I was safe before agreeing to meet me inside. &nbsp; When I arrived, she had me sit on a park bench across from her own, as she sat, poised to flee. &nbsp; She asked a series of challenging, aggressive questions. &nbsp;She was curious and skeptical about polyamory, and demanded that I justify what I was doing with it. &nbsp; This date was clearly going badly, and I realized that it would be the last one. &nbsp;Her body language remained closed and defensive, turned away from me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, it was time to go - the time she had allotted for our get-acquainted date had come to an end, and she signaled it was time to get up. &nbsp;I did, knowing what would happen next: &nbsp;she would thank me for my time and wish me well, perhaps shaking my hand. &nbsp; Nonetheless, I half heartedly offered a hug, by standing in front of her, and holding my hands slightly open near my sides, a vaguely pleasant expression on my face. &nbsp;She paused for a moment, looking at this, &nbsp;pondering what to do. &nbsp;And then she suddenly melted into my body and my arms, wrapping herself around me, and hotly pressing her body into me. &nbsp;The hug lasted at least five minutes. &nbsp;My groin was stirring, and I had no doubt that hers was also. &nbsp; We made plans to meet again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On our next date, we met to go for a walk along a main commercial street in her neighborhood. &nbsp;We went into various stores, talking to the shopkeepers. &nbsp;We ran into her friends and she introduced me. &nbsp;We walked arm in arm. &nbsp;People stopped us to tell us what a lovely couple we made, and wondered how long we&rsquo;d been together. &nbsp; We talked more about polyamory, and she seemed to come to accept it. &nbsp;At some point she suggested we head over to a nearby large park for a walk in the woods. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We headed up a wooded, secluded hill, away from passersby. &nbsp; We hugged and kissed. &nbsp;As before, the energy quickly mounted. &nbsp;She groped my groin. &nbsp;I slid my hands inside the waist of her trousers, down to her groin, and slid a finger into her very moist pussy, diddling her clit and sliding into her vagina. &nbsp;She moaned and sighed, clearly enjoying this. &nbsp;She unzipped my pants and pulled my cock out of my pants, starting to kneel down, clearly getting ready to blow me. &nbsp; Then all of a sudden she stopped herself: &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, straightening up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She talked about how if she were caught, she could lose her license and her career; that she was high profile and there would be no way out. &nbsp; She packed my cock away and zipped me up again. &nbsp; I smelled my damp fingers, disappointed but nonetheless savoring the moment, and looking forward to getting home and into bed with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But getting into bed with her wasn&rsquo;t in the cards that day - nonplussed by this experience, she sent me on my way, promising that we would get together in private the next time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I fantasized for days about our next get together, about how intense the sex would be. &nbsp; She wanted to meet up on the main street again, telling me we could walk to her house. &nbsp;Once we met, she told me that she&rsquo;d been thinking: &nbsp;This polyamory thing didn&rsquo;t really work for her. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t want to date someone who was in a relationship with someone else. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d call me if she wanted to get together - clearly she was looking for a fuck buddy, but it didn&rsquo;t seem likely she&rsquo;d call often. &nbsp; She diverted our walk before we made it to her house, and sent me on my way. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I never saw her again. &nbsp; &nbsp;Not wanting to accept what she wanted, I wrote her an intense email saying that I&rsquo;d be her date for a dinner party, helping her cook for it as she entertained friends - and it overwhelmed her. &nbsp;She wrote me a brief note a week later telling me that it was all too much for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, as I met with Cassandra, I kept her updated on my dating progress. &nbsp; Without telling her all the details, I told her about the lawyer, and how I thought we&rsquo;d sleep together on the next date. &nbsp; To my surprise, Cassandra was freaked out. &nbsp;She apparently hadn&rsquo;t realized that opening the relationship could actually lead to my sleeping with another woman. &nbsp; I listened to her, and held space, and eventually calmed her down. &nbsp;But afterwards I worried: &nbsp;What would happen when I actually slept with the lawyer lady, or with another person I dated?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My worries diminished when the lawyer lady blew me off, and not much else materialized. &nbsp;There was another woman I met a few times for a picnic in the park. &nbsp;I decided she wasn&rsquo;t someone I wanted to date. &nbsp;But I offhandedly offered her a Lomi-Lomi massage, a sensual Hawaiian massage technique I&rsquo;d taken a course in the previous year. &nbsp;To my surprise, she accepted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>That massage was </span><span class="c9">quite interesting.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; She kept her panties on, but was ok to be massaged everywhere else. &nbsp;I was gentle and respectful and followed her boundaries, and gave her an oily, sensual massage with my forearms. &nbsp;To my surprise, as I continued to massage her, even without any sexual touch she became highly aroused, and ended up coming intensely several times, squirting copiously. &nbsp;She was so pleased that she begged me to allow her to give me a blow job. &nbsp;I was so focused on giving her the massage that I almost said no, but eventually I relented. &nbsp; We talked of meeting again but never did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But otherwise the dating progress was slow, and my relationship with Cassandra, and my art work, kept me busy. &nbsp;I was preparing for the &ldquo;Nude and Free&rdquo; art residency, and I put the problem of dating other people to the side. &nbsp; Cassandra had been busy for months preparing for a show that was opening up in September, and I looked forward to finally getting away for the weekend with her in the fall a few times: &nbsp;we could go canoeing, and see the fall colours, after most of a year of no travel together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the &ldquo;Nude and Free&rdquo; residency ended, I reconnected with Cassandra. &nbsp; It was very difficult at first. &nbsp;I was feeling a bit jealous but also curious about her evening sojourns on the nude beach with her yoga teacher, Taylor. &nbsp;Cassandra told me, dreamily, how beautiful it had been, but that it was moving slowly, that there was nothing sexual, just, she hinted, a little hugging, and maybe some kissing. &nbsp;I shouldn&rsquo;t be concerned. &nbsp; But then she revealed, to my dismay, that while I was away she&rsquo;d slept with a former boyfriend, as a way to retaliate for all the many women she imagined that I&rsquo;d slept with on my art residency. &nbsp; I had a huge feeling of distrust and disappointment that she was retaliating for my imagined transgressions and then hiding it from me. &nbsp;But eventually I got over it, and she told me she was done with the former flame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cassandra&rsquo;s relationship with Taylor continued to grow slowly. &nbsp;She was glowing with excitement, and I had to admit that I enjoyed seeing her this way. &nbsp;I was delighted to feel compersion (as polyamorous people called it), joy for the happiness of another. &nbsp; Meanwhile, I continued with my dating attempts, regularly striking out. &nbsp; Cassandra reassured me that the flirtation with Taylor was nothing to worry about - Taylor was a woman, and Cassandra was straight, just curious about what it would be like to date a woman, and it wasn&rsquo;t even a sexual relationship; they&rsquo;d only hugged and kissed a little. &nbsp;But that I was her primary, and her relationship with Taylor wouldn&rsquo;t affect ours. &nbsp; I was skeptical, but decided to accept this at face value, for lack of an alternative. &nbsp;We talked about traveling together in the future, and possibly doing some kind of commitment ceremony. &nbsp;We even wrote some of these plans on a big blackboard on the wall in Cassandra&rsquo;s kitchen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then one day in the early fall of 2016, &nbsp;Cassandra reported a new development: &nbsp;Taylor had come over for dinner at Cassandra&rsquo;s, and had seen all these plans written on Cassandra&rsquo;s wall. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d been stunned and dismayed, and had broken down in tears, and had vowed her love for Cassandra. &nbsp;They&rsquo;d ended up going to bed together, and had spent the night in intense love making. &nbsp;It had been wonderful, Cassandra marveled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was a little surprised at the turn of events, but not stunned: &nbsp;it had seemed just a matter of time until the two of them actually got into bed. &nbsp; Cassandra followed up her announcement with a question: &nbsp;She and Taylor might like to spend a little time together in the coming weeks. &nbsp;Would I mind? &nbsp; I told her that was fine, and to send me an email with the day or two that they wanted to get together, so I could put it in my calendar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A day later, the email came, and I was stunned: &nbsp;She wanted to go away for the weekend with Taylor, not just once, but three times in the coming five weeks. &nbsp;And one of the other two weeks was already planned for Cassandra and me to go to another HCI workshop. &nbsp;If she and Taylor did that, there would be no time to go canoeing and see the fall colours together, because she would be away with Taylor. &nbsp; After months and months with no weekends together because of &nbsp;her work, Cassandra wanted to spend her weekends with her new girlfriend, not me. &nbsp; I was terrified: &nbsp;No longer was I Cassandra&rsquo;s primary partner, I was barely an afterthought. &nbsp; &nbsp;I pushed back: &nbsp; Did she need to do this? &nbsp;What about me? &nbsp;Did I matter anymore?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cassandra was firm on giving Taylor those the weekends, but started spending a lot of time with me during the week. &nbsp;We ran errands together, and she reassured me that I was important to her. &nbsp; I felt somewhat mollified, but disappointed that I was doing the prosaic, boring things with my beloved, and all the romantic things Cassandra was doing were happening with Taylor. &nbsp;I resolved to find someone else to do all the things I wanted to do with Cassandra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the weeks went by I went through a range of emotions: &nbsp; Fear that the relationship was over, then sadness that the spark was out of the relationship, then finally anger as I realized that Cassandra was complaining about her relationship with Taylor, and asking for my support, which I gave willingly, and then not giving me time or support in return. &nbsp; I felt cheated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, I continued to do my own dating. &nbsp;Just as Cassandra started seeing Taylor, I had a woman who I&rsquo;d gone on four dates with but never progressed beyond a kiss decide that it was enough. Disappointed with that, I went to a polyamory meetup night, with no intention of dating: &nbsp;I wanted to talk to a guy I knew, an older man, to ask him if I could interview him for my post-&ldquo;Nude and Free&rdquo; art project. &nbsp;I decided that finding another partner was something that could rest for a while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That mission accomplished, I overheard a younger woman standing where I was sitting asking questions about polyamory. &nbsp;One thing led to another and a few minutes later I found myself talking animatedly with Brittany, a short, vivacious blonde woman with a cute, upside-down smile. &nbsp;The conversation was rapid fire, playful, challenging. &nbsp;I found myself enjoying it. &nbsp; &nbsp;Before the evening was over, I found myself asking Brittany for her number.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day I texted Brittany: &nbsp; Would she like to get together? &nbsp;Would she come canoeing with me one day the next weekend?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brittany would like to get together, she wrote back, but not canoeing: &nbsp;She had a rule not to get into a car with a man she didn&rsquo;t know. &nbsp; But we could get together for dinner. &nbsp;I was crestfallen, but decided to make the best of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we met that weekend, while Cassandra was away on a romantic getaway with Taylor, for a dinner at a restaurant. &nbsp; We talked for hours about neuroplasticity (it turned out that Brittany had studied towards a PhD in neuroscience, before deciding to quit to become an environmental activist). &nbsp;We discovered that we enjoyed the conversations, and the repartee. &nbsp; As Brittany headed off, with a hug and a gentle kiss, we were making plans for our next get together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We continued to meet again, roughly every week or two, as the fall progressed and as Cassandra&rsquo;s relationship with Taylor deepened and then ebbed and flowed. &nbsp;Brittany revealed that she&rsquo;d had minimal success with dating and relationships over her whole lifetime and had decided to try polyamory because she liked the idea of having a less intense relationship, where her partner wouldn&rsquo;t be so emotionally dependent on her. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d dated a few guys who were in other relationships and had eventually realized that this worked for her. &nbsp; But she wanted to progress slowly, because she was uncomfortable, and had lots of self-judgments about her sexuality. &nbsp;For one thing, she didn&rsquo;t orgasm, and she felt that this was a problem for some of her partners.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I kept Cassandra apprised about my progress with Brittany, telling her that it was progressing, but that it wasn&rsquo;t clear to me if and when it might progress to sex.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, after several weeks of this, Cassandra and I went away for the weekend together to a HCI workshop, something we&rsquo;d planned for some months. &nbsp; It was our first since we&rsquo;d met each other, two years after our first. &nbsp; It was about self-love, a concept that I found challenging - it smacked of narcissism, but I went thinking it could prove useful. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The workshop was indeed challenging, particularly in how I saw men and women: &nbsp;I started to see women as more mutually supportive than men were, and I felt how much I wanted that kind of support in my life. &nbsp; And I was disappointed by men. &nbsp;In any event, by the end of the workshop, Cassandra and I were feeling reconnected and back in love, and at peace with the situation with Taylor, and Cassandra was curious about my relationship with Brittany, and where that might go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next night after HCI I saw Brittany again. &nbsp;She came over to my place, and sat at the opposite end of my sofa, and looked nervous. &nbsp;We talked, and talked, and talked, about desires, and boundaries, and what HCI had taught, and so on. &nbsp; Eventually, after a couple of hours, Brittany started looking a little more relaxed. &nbsp;A few minutes later, she came over and sat on my lap, straddling me, her jeans pressing into mine, her arms wrapped around me. &nbsp;We kissed. &nbsp;The next thing I knew my zipper was undone, Brittany&rsquo;s jeans were off, and she was straddling my cock. &nbsp; Our lovemaking was exciting for a moment, but brief and anticlimactic as I came quickly, and Brittany pulled herself off me and scuttled back to the other end of the sofa. &nbsp; I was surprised and pleased that this little act of sexual congress had happened, as I had been thinking that this polyamorous experiment was all for nought in terms of actual love making. &nbsp; It felt like a relief more than anything - finally some kind of middling success, after so much disappointment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day I had a date with Cassandra. &nbsp;We were going to join a group of my friends to visit an indoor trampoline park. &nbsp; On the way, I told her about what had happened with Brittany. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure what I expected Cassandra to do or feel. &nbsp;I suppose I hoped that she would be happy for me, or at least accepting. &nbsp; But it didn&rsquo;t go as I hoped: &nbsp;Cassandra was furious. How could I have done this? Especially after HAI, when we were feeling so connected. &nbsp; I should have known she would be upset that I had slept with Brittany right then. &nbsp;I should have kept that time sacred, just for us. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we drove to the trampoline park, the sparks flew. &nbsp;Recriminations and accusations filled the air. &nbsp;I tried to defend myself, saying that my having a miserable, anticlimactic &nbsp;5-minute sexual experience with a woman was much less of a big deal than her going away for a romantic weekend (or two, or three) with her lesbian lover. &nbsp;And Cassandra threw back that it was different, that sex with a woman didn&rsquo;t count, that I was the one that threatened our relationship. &nbsp;That she had never done anything to threaten our relationship like I had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time we made it to the event we were both completely wound up and furious with each other. &nbsp;But a couple of hours of bouncing in the air, of vigorous physical activity and fun, calmed us both down. &nbsp; By the trip home, Cassandra was in a better mood, and we headed home, for a nice bout of lovemaking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We carried on for a long time in the polycule, Cassandra with me and Taylor, and me with Cassandra and Brittany. &nbsp;Periodically conflict would come up. &nbsp;There would be anxieties and stresses and arguments. &nbsp;Then things would calm down for a while, and we&rsquo;d all enjoy the connection we were having.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The biggest conflict we had was over kink. &nbsp;Cassandra had asked me not to do kink with other partners, and I had agreed. &nbsp;When Brittany and I had started dating, the idea of kink never came up explicitly. &nbsp;But shortly after I started seeing her, she started to hint that she would be interested in exploring kink. &nbsp; I ignored these hints at first. &nbsp;Eventually Brittany was more explicit in her request. &nbsp; I said I wasn&rsquo;t interested. &nbsp; She persisted, asking me why I wasn&rsquo;t interested? &nbsp;She&rsquo;d surmised that there was some kink in my relationship with Cassandra, and wondered why I wouldn&rsquo;t do it with her. &nbsp; I said I just didn&rsquo;t want to. &nbsp; Brittany kept worrying the point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally I snapped, and told her that I had agreed with Cassandra that kink was off the table in my other relationships. &nbsp;Brittany was aghast. &nbsp;I allowed one partner to dictate what I did with another? &nbsp;She pulled out a long list of polyamory dos-and-don&rsquo;t, and on this list that was clearly a no-no. &nbsp; &nbsp;It was unfair and inappropriate, the list said, and represented hierarchical thinking. &nbsp;Not acceptable for polyamory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pondered this, and thought about it, and realized that this agreement was about protecting Cassandra&rsquo;s feelings, not about what was best for me or for Brittany. &nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t completely convinced, but I spoke about it with Cassandra, telling her that Brittany wanted to be kinky with me, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I wanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now you might imagine Cassandra&rsquo;s reaction. &nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t pretty. &nbsp;I guess I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be when I reluctantly broached the subject.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Some months later, after many difficult conversations, often involving raised voices and storming out, I started to gingerly attempt some kink with Brittany. &nbsp;I took some rope on an overnight trip with her, and loosely tied her wrists together and to a chair, and then made love to her. &nbsp;It was nothing compared to what I&rsquo;d done with Cassandra, but it aroused Brittany incredibly, and I enjoyed that. &nbsp; So I began to gently explore kink with Brittany, one scene at a time. &nbsp;And to enter a series of fights with Cassandra.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c35" id="h.5p5v416r1ghy"><span class="c13">Chapter 19: Conflicts &amp; Awareness</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We moved to the living room. &nbsp; Jack asked, &ldquo;So how did it play out with your two partners and polyamory? &nbsp; I seem to remember that things got pretty complicated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sighed.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I continued to do elaborate, intense, kinky scenes with Cassandra several nights a month, and to gradually explore milder scenes with Brittany. &nbsp; Cassandra was a brat and a hellion, needing to be subdued and put to heel in our scenes, ready at any time to break out of submission&hellip; until eventually she would give up and relinquish control, and settle back for to allow herself to be pleasured by various types of sensations - from spanks to blows with a paddle to gentle caresses to stimulation from a Hitachi Magic Wand, the powerful &ldquo;personal massager&rdquo; that we quickly learned that the kink community used as its vibrator of choice. &nbsp; Cassandra would eventually give into the stimulation of the Magic Wand on her pussy&hellip;. Convulsions would roil her body as she wailed in pleasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brittany was different. &nbsp;She was always nervous before a scene, but once it started she would readily submit. &nbsp; A complicated relationship with her parents and a lifetime of relational challenges had left unable to readily feel sexual pleasure and unable to orgasm, but she enjoyed submitting to me. &nbsp; After a few more attempts at home, she hinted that she might enjoy a kinky scene in public - at a fetish party or sex club.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One Sunday afternoon we made plans to head to Club 69, a sex club on a grungy commercial street in Etobicoke, for a kinky scene. &nbsp;I packed my back full of toys and we headed off. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We stopped at a restaurant to have a light snack. &nbsp;Brittany was so nervous she was almost hyperventilating. &nbsp; We talked. &nbsp;I suggested that maybe we could skip the club visit, and wait until she felt more ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, she said, she wanted it. And so in we went, after she had calmed down a little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the door I put a collar on her and paraded her inside. &nbsp;We ended up occupying a private room in the sex area. &nbsp;I left the door open so other people could see us, but put a cordon across the doorway so that voyeurs would know that they weren&rsquo;t welcome to come in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had Brittany keel on the edge of the bed, her pretty round ass facing the doorway, her face laying down on the bed, her wrists cuffed together. &nbsp; I started in on her bottom, first with my palm, spanking her until her butt was a pretty shade of pink, then progressing to a flogger, a paddle, and even a few relatively gentle strokes from my riding crop. &nbsp; Each time I ratcheted up the intensity, her wails intensified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soon there was a crowd at the doorway, all there to see the source of this wondrous noise. &nbsp; I moved Brittany around, fondling her ass, then her pussy. &nbsp;Her wails intensified into a paroxysm of inchoate, incoherent emotion. &nbsp;I imagined that they were audible throughout the entire club. &nbsp;I was focused on her, playing with her as with a toy - a loud, quivering toy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, after perhaps an hour of screams and wails, I slowly relented, gradually releasing Brittany from her submission. &nbsp; She slowly resurfaced, and so did I. &nbsp; As I looked around, I noticed that the onlookers were cheering and congratulating us. &nbsp; &ldquo;Nice job!&rdquo; one said. &nbsp; Another commented how lucky I was to have such a beautiful and sexy woman to play with. &nbsp; Others stopped us as we left the club to say how amazing the connection between us had seemed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After our visit to Club 69, Brittany was in heaven. &nbsp;She wanted more. &nbsp; I&rsquo;d been flirting for months with both Cassandra and Brittany that it would be fun to do a kinky threesome, in which I would top both of my partners. &nbsp;Brittany had even written up a series of kinky fantasies about how such a scene might play out. &nbsp;But with the ongoing conflicts and antipathy between the two women, both were reluctant to actually do it. &nbsp;Cassandra eventually had come around to agreeing to do it if Brittany would. &nbsp; After Club 69, Brittany decided: &nbsp;she wanted that kinky threesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that decision, my planner went into overdrive. &nbsp;With all the conflicts between my partners, I wanted the perfect plan for the evening, anticipating every problem. &nbsp;I concocted an elaborate sequence of events for the evening that I thought would balance the desires of both partners and be enjoyable for me. &nbsp;I drafted a creative invitation for a night of revels, and we set the date.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Prior to the evening, there was a flurry of negotiations. &nbsp;Cassandra had few constraints, but Brittany had many. &nbsp;In particular, she demanded that Cassandra not be allowed to touch her except under my specific direction. &nbsp; She would agree to be touched by Cassandra, and to touch her in return, but only on my say so. &nbsp;She also required that condoms be used for all sexual intercourse with either woman. &nbsp;(Normally I used condoms only with Brittany).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the night of the scene, I had Cassandra arrive first. &nbsp;She looked spectacular in her corset, with her long slender legs. &nbsp;We executed our ritual transfer of power, I put her collar on, I stripped off her superfluous clothing, and I tied her on her back to my bed, legs spread wide, pussy exposed and stretched. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shortly later, Brittany arrived, also clad in a corset, also looking sexy. &nbsp; She looked pale and her breathing was shallow. &nbsp;I asked her if she was ready and wanted to go ahead, and she said she was and did. &nbsp;I put on my sternest expression, and we executed our power transfer ritual, similar in some ways but simpler than and varying in some details from the one Cassandra and I used.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stripped Brittany down and drew her into the bedroom. &nbsp; She saw that Cassandra was already there, tied to the bed. &nbsp;She looked taken aback - she hadn&rsquo;t expected that Cassandra would be there first. &nbsp;Cassandra got a little lippy with me, and I reminded her using a riding crop that she needed to strictly follow my orders, which had included no speaking. &nbsp; She settled back, quite satisfied with the bruises she had earned, and not needing any more at the moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I blindfolded Brittany and directed her to her knees in front of me, and made her suck my cock for a while. &nbsp;I thought Cassandra might enjoy seeing that. &nbsp;When I got bored of that, I removed Brittany&rsquo;s blindfold and pushed her face down on the bed, directly in front of Cassandra&rsquo;s pussy. &nbsp;I touched Cassandra&rsquo;s pussy and drew my moist finger towards Brittany&rsquo;s face, intending to make her smell her rival&rsquo;s scent. &nbsp;Brittany recoiled, looking alarmed. &nbsp; I relented a little, and allowed her to slide farther away from Cassandra. &nbsp;Then I spanked and paddled Brittany for a while, &nbsp;I tried to fuck her from behind &hellip; I wanted each thrust to push her face towards Cassandra&rsquo;s pussy. &nbsp;But putting on my condom proved problematic. &nbsp;Even though I had taken a Viagra beforehand, I found that I had trouble getting hard - I was too stressed by the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, I gave up on that. &nbsp;I judged that Britany was ready for the next step. &nbsp;It seemed to me that things were going well&hellip;. Brittany looked a bit frightened, but it seemed to me that she was aroused. &nbsp;It seemed perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next, according to my complex plan, I was going to put Brittany on the bed beside Cassandra, also tied in place, so that I could control touching between them. &nbsp;Cassandra hadn&rsquo;t wanted to know what Brittany&rsquo;s limits were, so I had merely impressed on her that she was only allowed to touch Brittany upon my instruction. &nbsp;But I thought some rope would be a helpful reminder. &nbsp;To prepare for the next maneuver, I untied Cassandra&rsquo;s left leg from the left bedpost at the foot of the bed, and retied it to the right bedpost. &nbsp;Her arms were already tied together, fixed near the headboard on the right side. &nbsp; &nbsp;I judged that this would leave enough space for Brittany, and keep Cassandra safely away from my other partner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pulled Britany over to the side of the bed and instructed her to get on the bed. &nbsp; She shook her head, not saying anything. &nbsp;In the absence of a safeword, I took this as an invitation to escalate the pressure - it seemed like she was playing at resisting. &nbsp; &nbsp;But I noted how closed and distant she seemed, and started considering whether to cut more items from my plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pushed her down onto the bed next to Cassandra, and began to tie her carefully, so that she wouldn&rsquo;t touch her rival, and so Cassandra wouldn&rsquo;t be able to touch her. &nbsp;I attached her cuffed wrists to the left side of the headboard, and her legs together, close to the left bedpost at the foot of the bed. &nbsp;Both women were now tied, a foot or two apart, face up and side by side on the bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brittany was pale and trembling. &nbsp; Cassandra glanced over at her foe&hellip;. And something appeared to melt inside her. &nbsp;With a gentle smile, she rolled over on her side, and stretched her head over toward Brittany, a maneuver I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated, and gave her bedmate a companionable kiss on the shoulder. &nbsp; A kind of &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in this together, kid&rdquo; kiss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A wild scream emerged from Brittany. &nbsp;&ldquo;DON&rsquo;T TOUCH ME!!&rdquo; &nbsp;she yelled. &nbsp;&ldquo;Stop! &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t give you permission to touch me! &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; &nbsp; She quivered and sobbed in terror and disgust. &nbsp; Cassandra recoiled, looking shocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This wasn&rsquo;t according to plan. &nbsp; The plan, I realized, was kaput, out the window. &nbsp;The scene was over. &nbsp;We were done, and back to repair and aftercare. &nbsp;All the rules, all the constraints - they had failed. I had failed. &nbsp;The three-way Brittany had promised wasn&rsquo;t going to happen - it was a mirage. &nbsp;I was pissed at Brittany - she&rsquo;d not even remembered her safeword. &nbsp;Bait and switch. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t a great way to exit a scene, but there we were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I held Brittany, seeking to calm her down. &nbsp;Eventually she did, &nbsp;Her breathing slowed. &nbsp;Her colour returned. &nbsp;She felt warm and connected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I put my other arm around Cassandra, who snuggled into me. &nbsp; After Brittany had calmed a little, I sought to reassure Cassandra &hellip; I hugged her, and then kissed her. &nbsp;She kissed me back, first warmly, and then hungrily. &nbsp; I noticed, to my surprise, that I was getting a little turned on.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I went back to Brittany, kissing her again, and noticed she was also getting turned on. &nbsp; The arousal after the intensity of the previous events was a welcome relief, I thought for everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found myself getting hard. &nbsp; I felt how wet Cassandra was. &nbsp; I could see that Brittany also looked turned on, and seemed to be enjoying it when I touched Cassandra. &nbsp;I decided to make the best of the situation&hellip;. I pulled out a condom, and pulled it out of the package, and tried to put it over my cock&hellip;. &nbsp;But I noticed that the tight condom pinched at my not-altogether hard penis, and my erection wilted. &nbsp;I stroked myself to regain my hardness, and tried again, with the same result. &nbsp;Brittany was half-watching, her eyes partly closed, enjoying the touch from my hand on her pussy and the sexual energy between me and Cassandra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a few more tries with the condom, I gave up, realizing that it wouldn&rsquo;t work. &nbsp;If I managed to get the condom on, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to have sex. I pulled the condom away from my cock, up towards my face, &nbsp;and then ostentatiously tossed it away. &nbsp;It seemed to me that Brittany watched me do it. &nbsp;One of my hands was on her body, and she seemed to be sighing happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next I made a decision I came to regret. &nbsp; I reasoned that if the scene was over and both women were happy, the pre-negotiated rules no longer applied. &nbsp;As long as they were both good with what was happening, I could proceed. &nbsp; And besides, I thought less charitably, what did I care about what I had promised to Brittany, if she flipped out like that when Cassandra just tried to be kind to her. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t right. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d promised something and didn&rsquo;t deliver.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I looked into Brittany&rsquo;s eyes, locked in eye contact, as I slid my bare cock into Cassandra&rsquo;s warm, wet pussy. &nbsp;She smiled at me. &nbsp;I thrust a few times into Cassandra, making it clear to Brittany I was inside her. &nbsp;Brittany continued to look at me with desire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wriggled around, with difficulty placing my face between Brittany&rsquo;s legs, which were bound together at the ankles, but there was enough space to accomplish my goal. &nbsp;The next moments were divine: &nbsp;my cock was thrusting into Cassdra&rsquo;s vagina and my face was buried in Brittany&rsquo;s. &nbsp;It was one of the most amazing feelings I&rsquo;d experienced in my life. &nbsp;Both women were sighing and panting and moaning happily. &nbsp;Somehow, after all this conflict and turmoil, we had created a moment of deep connection and joy, with no rules necessary. &nbsp;The sexual energy built. &nbsp;It felt that we were all building towards a shattering orgasm, even possibly Brittany, who never orgasmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then I felt Brittany sit up suddenly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; she cried out. &ldquo;Are you wearing a condom? You aren&rsquo;t, are you? &nbsp;We agreed to use condoms!&rdquo; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pulled my face out of Brittany&rsquo;s lap and stared at her dumbfounded. &nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t she been paying attention? &nbsp;Was she just playing at this, going along for a while in order to pull out a trumped up charge?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started to ask Brittany if she was being serious, but her outrage had escalated into something else - something primal, a wail of deep betrayal and abandonment. &nbsp; I disengaged from Cassandra. &nbsp; I realized that Brittany was still bound to the bed, and I untied and held her. &nbsp; I was still confused, but realized that Brittany was beside herself, crying and trembling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I realized I needed to take her away from the situation. &nbsp;I made eye contact with Cassandra. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok. &nbsp;Take care of her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I led Brittany to the living room to calm her down, leaving Cassandra tied to the bed, thinking I&rsquo;d be back in a couple of minutes to let her free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The couple of minutes stretched to many minutes, maybe fifteen or twenty, as Brittany wailed about how I had abandoned her, hadn&rsquo;t protected her, hadn&rsquo;t followed our agreement. &nbsp; How it had reminded her of an sexual assault that she had experienced, in which a man had surreptitiously made love to her without protection. &nbsp; I felt dismay and remorse. &nbsp;Hadn&rsquo;t our scene been over? &nbsp;But Brittany reminded me that she had been still tied up, and we hadn&rsquo;t technically transferred power back, so the scene was still on. &nbsp;It was a mess, and I felt angered, confused, and remorseful, all at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually there was a noise coming from the direction of the bedroom. &nbsp;It was Cassandra. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d freed herself, and came out in high dudgeon. &nbsp; &ldquo;I can see who&rsquo;s important to you,&rdquo; she sneered, her voice dripping with venom. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home. &nbsp;Have a nice night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I angrily implored her to stay, but she threw on her coat and headed out in a trice. &nbsp;Now I was upset. &nbsp;I had upset my primary partner, whom I adored, to support my secondary partner, whom I was pissed off at. &nbsp;I was beyond dismayed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brittany could see my upset, and in turn became angry at me: &nbsp;&ldquo;How can you care for her? &nbsp;She&rsquo;s a bitch!&rdquo; she snarled. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t obey the rules, and she doesn&rsquo;t deserve your love.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upset beyond measure, I grabbed a nearby wineglass and hurled it with all the force I could muster across the room at the large brick fireplace. &nbsp;The glass exploded, sending little shards of glass flying about the room. &nbsp;&ldquo;Go&rdquo; I snarled. &nbsp; &ldquo;I want you out of here. &nbsp;I need to think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brittany sulked off. &nbsp;By this time it was after midnight. &nbsp; I sat and pondered what to do for a while, cooling off. &nbsp;Eventually the path became clear to me. &nbsp;I dressed, headed downstairs, got on my bike, and headed over to Cassandra&rsquo;s. &nbsp; I found her still up, moodily drinking a glass of wine on her porch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next weeks were difficult. &nbsp;Each time I met with either partner I faced rancour and recriminations. &nbsp;Cassandra was mostly mad at Brittany, though she was peeved that I had abandoned her tied to the bed to take care of Brittany. &nbsp;Brittany was mad at Cassandra for kissing her, but mostly mad at me for breaking my word to use a condom with Cassandra. &nbsp;She said she felt violated, like I had raped her. &nbsp;She demanded I apologize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, I felt duped by Brittany - she had said she wanted to do something she clearly had no intention to do, and she&rsquo;d only done this as a faithless attempt to salvage our relationship, which had been rocky. &nbsp;And then she had failed to take care of herself - she hadn&rsquo;t used her safeword when she should have. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d had a panic attack, which I hadn&rsquo;t recognized, and she hadn&rsquo;t disclosed to me that this was a possibility. &nbsp; And my supposed violation had happened after the scene was over, so it wasn&rsquo;t really a violation.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, grudgingly, I apologized. &nbsp;I acknowledged that I shouldn&rsquo;t have had bareback sex with Cassandra, and that I had failed in that, that I had broken my promise. &nbsp;But I refused to take full responsibility for the whole imbroglio - I told Brittany that I thought if she wanted to do kink, she had better take responsibility using her safewords to protect herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brittany demanded that I talk to some other doms to learn what I should have done. &nbsp; A few weeks later I found myself in a downtown pub, talking with a stranger I&rsquo;d found through an online polyamory community. &nbsp; He told me that he was familiar with kink, and he often dommed others, and sometimes even did that while being dommed himself. &nbsp;He was pretty fluent and familiar with complex kinky situations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I described what had happened, and asked him if I had been wrong. &nbsp; What he said was interesting: &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard. &nbsp;It sounds like it was a hard situation. &nbsp;Yes, you could have done some things differently, but it&rsquo;s hard to tell when someone has a panic attack, and they can&rsquo;t access their safewords. &nbsp;You normally rely on the sub to take care of themselves, and it&rsquo;s hard if you can&rsquo;t. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no real easy way out.&rdquo; &nbsp; We talked some more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, after more talking and more thought, I realized that the issue wasn&rsquo;t so much with how I reacted in the moment. &nbsp;Rather, it was in how I acted in the moments leading up to the event: &nbsp;How much was I aware of the risks and triggers of my partners? &nbsp;How had I tried to handle the conflict? &nbsp;Had I made everyone aware of all the agreements? &nbsp; Had I assessed whether my partners were really ready for this, or had I pushed them into something they weren&rsquo;t read for? &nbsp;And then at the time of the scene, was I connected and present with both partners? &nbsp;Did I know to check in to verify that they hadn&rsquo;t disassociated, that they hadn&rsquo;t gone into a panic attack? &nbsp;Could I differentiate that from deep subspace?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also realized that it wasn&rsquo;t just me&hellip; the whole situation was a complex dynamic with triggers on all sides. &nbsp;There was a lot of risk, and just coming up with a complex plan wouldn&rsquo;t guarantee that I could handle the unpredictable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, things were complex with both relationships. &nbsp;I continued to see Brittany, but she was reluctant to do kink again. &nbsp; We talked about it&hellip;. She wanted to but was scared. &nbsp;She kept on throwing up new demands: &nbsp;I should read this book, or that book. &nbsp;I should talk to more people. &nbsp;And so on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time things were rocky with Cassandra, and I noticed that she was spending more and more time with Taylor, and doing more things, things she said she&rsquo;d never do, like going to Xanadu with her. &nbsp;Their relationship seemed to be growing, while ours was sputtering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, the third or fourth time Brittany demanded that I do more, that I somehow change, I&rsquo;d had enough. &nbsp;I answered her long email, saying that my appetite for this had gone out the window. &nbsp;Something had snapped. &nbsp;She should either accept where things were, or leave me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She left me, somewhat to my surprise. &nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t happy, but it seemed the only way out. &nbsp;It was around November of 2017. &nbsp;I was feeling a little needy and powerless.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things progressed along for a while. &nbsp; Cassandra continued to date Taylor, and the three of us spent a little time together. &nbsp;It was nice. &nbsp;The distance between Taylor and me seemed to be diminishing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then one day I had an idea. &nbsp;Maybe I could invite Cassandra to Xanadu, and have Taylor join us. &nbsp; I wrote to Taylor about the idea. &nbsp;She was cautious but seemed intrigued. &nbsp;She had a lot of questions. &nbsp;We went into an exchange about it. &nbsp;Eventually she concluded that she wasn&rsquo;t into it - it didn&rsquo;t feel right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Trying to make me feel better about it, Taylor tried to pay me a compliment. &nbsp;She wrote that I was a nice man. &nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t interested in me, but I was very nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something about this set me off. &nbsp;I was not a nice man! &nbsp;I was a powerful, sexy man, and that&rsquo;s why Cassandra liked me. &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like being patronized and misunderstood and dismissed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wrote back to Taylor, with a long angry email, very sexual, in which I told her that what Cassandra liked about me was my cock, and I wrote in graphic detail about the prowess of my cock. &nbsp; (In retrospect, perhaps not the wisest argument to make to a lesbian, at least not one who I wanted to be friends with.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was shocked. &nbsp;&ldquo;How could you write that?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;What have I done to provoke this outburst?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I realized that I had overstepped, but I was still frosted. &nbsp;I waited a day or two to cool off. &nbsp;Then I set out to answer her question - as I thought, to be helpful. &nbsp;Basically, I wrote, Taylor was a tease. &nbsp;She would show interest in me - for instance, I&rsquo;d invited Taylor out for a drink at some point to connect a little, and she&rsquo;d pressed her leg against mine. &nbsp; And then she&rsquo;d pull back. &nbsp; The reason that guys got the wrong idea about her is that she encouraged them by flirting with them, and then acted shocked when they expressed a desire towards her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, this wrong-headed missive accomplished something: &nbsp; It set Taylor off. &nbsp;She started texting Cassandra and me about how I was harassing her, and sending her lewd comments, and then blaming her - blaming the victim. &nbsp;I was a textual sexual harasser.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stunned, I had to admit she had a point. &nbsp;I had harassed her, and then I had blamed her. &nbsp;Textbook. &nbsp;I instantly apologized to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Cassandra reacted: &ldquo;Why did you apologize to her? &nbsp;I lost complete respect for you when you did that!&rdquo; &nbsp;She told me that she didn&rsquo;t want to see me &hellip; she wanted time to cool off, to evaluate things. &nbsp; We had a trip to the US planned in six weeks, and she wasn&rsquo;t ready to cancel that yet, but she didn&rsquo;t want to see me until then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next weeks were difficult. &nbsp;I engaged a female relationship therapist specializing in non-monogamous relationships &nbsp;to help me get to the bottom of my misogyny and harassing behavior. &nbsp;To my surprise, the relationship therapist wasn&rsquo;t interested in that. &nbsp;She heard my story, and told me how interesting it was. &nbsp; How I&rsquo;d been using strategies to meet my needs. &nbsp;But what were my needs? &nbsp;She said that digging into that would help me solve the riddle of what had happened with Taylor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was stunned. &nbsp;My needs? &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d never thought like this. &nbsp;And what about my problem with women? &nbsp;What was the need there? &nbsp;Couldn&rsquo;t she just tell me what to do to fix my problem?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started journaling about my needs, expanding on work I&rsquo;d done in the past journaling about feelings and beliefs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, I kept in touch a little bit with Brittany. &nbsp;I thought I wasn&rsquo;t interested in having her back as a partner, but maybe we could go out now and then. &nbsp;Particularly as I was on break from Cassandra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I invited Brittany to a kinky public party. &nbsp; She was surprised, but agreed, on condition that I didn&rsquo;t expect her to do any kink with her&hellip;. Well, we did a sexy public spanking scene, and ended up in bed at my place afterward. &nbsp;And gradually back into an ongoing relationship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, I emailed sporadically with Cassandra. &nbsp; She had decided to focus on Taylor, but hadn&rsquo;t 100% given up on me&hellip; &nbsp;but there was no meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually it came time for our trip. &nbsp;We met at the airport, not having seen each other for weeks. &nbsp;It was tense, but we were clearly both glad to see each other. &nbsp; We went on our short trip, a visit to American museum where Cassandra was doing some work. &nbsp; By the end of the weekend, the distance was bridged, and we were gradually connecting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So both of my relationships were reconnecting, but Cassandra was having trouble with her other relationship. &nbsp; Taylor was livid that Cassandra was seeing her abuser again, and jacked up the attacks on me. &nbsp;I tried to apologize again, but she refused me. &nbsp;Meanwhile, Cassandra&rsquo;s life was challenging: &nbsp;If I texted her when Taylor could see it, it provoked a nasty reaction. &nbsp;Taylor became increasingly threatening, saying that she would ostracize Cassandra from her extended community if Cassandra kept seeing me.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cassandra kept me in the loop. I tried to support her as well as I could. &nbsp;Despite her attacks on me, I still liked Taylor. &nbsp;I still remembered the loving connection we&rsquo;d had a couple of years before on our MDMA trip. &nbsp;But it wasn&rsquo;t working.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually Cassandra had had enough of the conflict. &nbsp;She realized that she couldn&rsquo;t raise the issues and discuss them with Taylor in any kind of productive way, so in an act of self-preservation she brutally shut down the relationship with her, telling her that she didn&rsquo;t want to be friends, and she didn&rsquo;t want Taylor to text her or email her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was relieved that the conflict was over, but very sad that Taylor was no longer in our lives; despite all the conflict I had a soft spot in my heart for her. &nbsp;But the end of that relationship made things easier; &nbsp;Cassandra and I headed off on a long trip to the US Southwest, feeling energized and reconnected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After this, things became tricky once again for me&hellip; Cassandra became more focused on my on-going relationship with Brittany, more jealous. &nbsp;She claimed she was done with polyamory, but I didn&rsquo;t believe it. &nbsp;I figured that six months later she&rsquo;d be over Taylor and looking for another partner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Six months went by, and something did change: &nbsp;Cassandra dumped me again. &nbsp;This time, it appeared, for good.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c17" id="h.5d1mjzad2sv8"><span class="c13">Chapter 20: Multi-Person Relating</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jack said, &ldquo;God, I remember that. &nbsp;You were so stunned, so sad. &nbsp;But it helped us get closer, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first I didn&rsquo;t believe that Cassandra was serious. &nbsp; She&rsquo;d distanced herself from me numerous times before, and had always come around. &nbsp;But as the days went by and she refused to budge, I began to get nervous, and then, as the reality sank in, to grieve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things had seemed that they were going well. &nbsp; Cassandra and I had been experimenting with some multi-person relating: &nbsp;we&rsquo;d gone to a polyamorous speed dating meetup as a couple in the fall (of 2018) and had met a few singles (a couple of men and a woman) that we were interested in playing with. &nbsp;There was the tall, lanky bald guy who we both found sexy but turned out to be a germaphobe &hellip;. An interesting evening, but not one that we really wanted to repeat. &nbsp;And there was a shibari expert who elaborately tied Cassandra as I photographed. &nbsp; She enjoyed the tying but wasn&rsquo;t really into the guy. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d even arranged a surprise (for Cassandra) kinky threesome with the woman, Sal, which had gone pretty well, and had left me elated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But shortly after that, Cassandra had discovered that I had RSVPed for a massage exchange evening being arranged by some friends&hellip;. I had meant it as a statement of intent, and planned to discuss it with Cassandra, meaning to go only if she would go with me (and assuming that she would)... but she took it badly, thinking that I was looking for an escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At a painting masterclass in mid December, two days after our revel with Sal, still basking in the glow of our sexy evening, I started getting upset texts from Cassandra. &nbsp; I figured it was nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t nothing. &nbsp;After an escalating series of messages, I went to bed early, trying to recuperate from the intense weekend: &nbsp;successfully arranging a surprise sexy threesome, two day painting masterclass lasting until late at night, upset lover. &nbsp;I thought my mind would be clearer in the morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next thing I heard steps pounding up my stairs and the sound of someone in my kitchen, outside my bedroom door: &nbsp;It was Cassandra, using her key. &nbsp;I came out of the bedroom to greet her. &nbsp; She snarled and screamed in rage at me, flailing her arms at me, calling me names: &nbsp;a fucker, scared, not a man. &nbsp;I grabbed her, trying to stop the blows raining down on my torso. &nbsp;We wrestled as she continued to wail incoherently. &nbsp;I pulled her into the bedroom.We both started getting turned on&hellip; or at least I did. &nbsp;There was a moment of relief &hellip; we both smiled a little. &nbsp; I thought it was over. &nbsp;I was ready to pull her into bed with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pushed my arms away. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done with you,&rdquo; she coldly stated. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t follow me.&rdquo; &nbsp;And she turned on her heel and headed out the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We started a long, angry email exchange. &nbsp; She complained that I was looking to leave her, that I needed validation from any number of women, that I wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;arrived&rdquo;, that I was needy. &nbsp;I complained that she was capricious, unpredictable, aggressive, and that she wasn&rsquo;t working on herself. &nbsp; I said that I could imagine getting back together with her someday, but I wouldn&rsquo;t take her back until she did: &nbsp; she needed therapy, workshops, journalling, or something, anything. &nbsp; Maybe in five years she would be ready for me. &nbsp;Certainly not in less than a year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once I got over my initial anger, I fell into despair: &nbsp;The love of my life for the past four years or more was no longer in my life. &nbsp; I cried. &nbsp; I went to the massage exchange evening alone, telling the people there that my heart wasn&rsquo;t into it, that I wouldn&rsquo;t participate&hellip; but I did, and ended up enjoying it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This turned out to be a theme: &nbsp;To rebound from the loss of Cassandra, I threw myself at others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I invited Sal over to commiserate with me (she had also recently had a relationship go sour) on Christmas Eve, and after crying for a while, we made love for the rest of the evening, and the next morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I went with Brittany to a New Year&rsquo;s Eve party hosted by some sexy friends in the community &hellip; we ended up in sexy 6-person naked groping session, followed by some side-by-side doggy style sex, where I fucked Brittany from behind while my good friend Jack did the same to his partner, Amber.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To my surprise, Brittany decided that she enjoyed this kind of thing. &nbsp; A long sequence of sexy threesomes and foursomes ensued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I invited Sal and Brittany to a get-acquainted dinner at a restaurant that served its patrons in the dark, using blind waitstaff. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d hinted strongly to both of them that I&rsquo;d be interested in a threesome. &nbsp;Sal was delighted at the idea; Brittany had never been with a woman and never had a threesome (other than the aborted attempt with Cassandra), so was nervous about the idea, but curious after the enjoyable New Year&rsquo;s Eve experience. &nbsp; We met briefly in a (lighted) coffeeshop beforehand. &nbsp;Brittany was extremely nervous and skittish, and my hopes of anything sexy happening that evening plummeted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But at the restaurant Sal and Brittany hit it off, flirting with each other, and giggling, and caressing each other in the dark. &nbsp;Next we went to a nearby pub for a drink. &nbsp;After a drink or two, Brittany unwound further, and playfully, then sensually kissed Sal. &nbsp;Eventually, we all realized that this part of the evening needed to come to the end. &nbsp;Sal talked about going home. &nbsp;Before I had a chance to say anything, Brittany invited Sal to join us at my place, if I was ok with that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, sure, that sounds like fun,&rdquo; I mumbled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few minutes later I found myself in my kitchen, getting out the chilled champagne I had arranged just in case, while Brittany and Sal romped in the bed together, fully nude, laughing. &nbsp;I was delighted that the evening was going so well, with so little effort on my part. &nbsp; I soon joined them in bed and showed Brittany how to go down on a woman. &nbsp;She was hesitant at first, her first time, but soon got into it. &nbsp;A good time was had by all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ushered in a series of sexy get-togethers. &nbsp;Jack and Amber and Brittany and I got together for a sexy evening&hellip; that was fun, but Amber got a little triggered, and the evening wound down with more connecting and caretaking than lovemaking. Sal and Brittany and I had another threesome, this one planned as a birthday present for me. &nbsp;And so it went. &nbsp; Sal and I drifted into dating, eventually having a threesome with Sal&rsquo;s friend Betty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was loving this exciting, sexy connecting. &nbsp;I found that it wasn&rsquo;t just about having amazing sex. &nbsp;It was also about connecting with different people in different ways. &nbsp;Learning about their triggers. &nbsp;Supporting them when things went wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that half the time or more when I had a threesome or a foursome, at least one person had a major reaction - a meltdown, a freakout, you name it. &nbsp; At first this seemed catastrophic - it was a reminder of the awful kinky threesome with Brittany and Cassandra, over a year ago, and I worried that it would lead to consequences - a breakup, a strained friendship, or whatever. &nbsp; In fact, when I thought back, most of my multi-person experiences had been triggering. &nbsp;The four way massage in Ottawa, the post-HCI get together with Anya and Cassandra, the MDMA trip with Cassandra and Taylor, and a few other experiences along the way. &nbsp;In each case at least one person had a major reaction either during or before or after the event.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this time around, by chilling and holding space for the reacting person, the other people managed to navigate the situation. &nbsp;In many cases, after the reaction was over we could continue to connect, often in a deeper and more sexy way than would have been possible before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Along with dating Brittany and Sal, I had started seeing a kind and thoughtful woman named Maya. &nbsp; With Maya it wasn&rsquo;t about sex, or at least not for a long time: &nbsp;we had long and connective dinners where we shared about our pasts, and our beliefs. &nbsp;Maya was reluctant to move quickly on anything physical, though eventually she opened up to hugging, then gradually to cuddling. &nbsp;But I felt wonderful when I was around her, cared for and accepted. &nbsp;And I loved her slender and fit body. &nbsp;So it started to be clear to me that I was living the solo polyamorous lifestyle: &nbsp;I had three partners, plus going to the occasional sexy event, like a massage exchange, and having the occasional multi-person sexy time. &nbsp;Each partner gave me something different: &nbsp;adventure, connection, curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something that started to dawn on me during this time was that not only did I enjoy playing with several other people at a time, but I enjoyed connecting more broadly with groups: &nbsp;going out for dinner with Brittany and Jack and Amber, for instance, was a lot of fun. &nbsp;It was like dating, but with four people rather than two. &nbsp;And talking and holding space for reactions and so on let me get to know people in a whole new way: not just how they responded to me, but how they responded to other people. &nbsp;I started seeing relationships (romantic or sexual or even platonic) as something that didn&rsquo;t have to involve just two people: &nbsp;there could be three or four or possibly more. &nbsp; And these multi-person relationships could be a source of growth and joy, just like the garden-variety twosomes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Throughout all of this I kept very busy, with a social calendar almost completely booked up. &nbsp; But on nights when I was by myself, I found myself grieving Cassandra: &nbsp;how she put candles out for dinner. &nbsp;How she made our morning coffee. &nbsp;Our long and wide-ranging conversations. &nbsp; As fun and exciting as all these new get togethers were, I missed the connection and the (relative) stability of our relationship. &nbsp;I missed having someone I could tell my stories to who didn&rsquo;t need a primer on context - who got it right away. &nbsp; I would decide to relax for an evening, and make myself a drink - maybe a tropical fruit punch. &nbsp;It would go down smoothly, and then another would seem like a good idea &nbsp; And then I would find myself at midnight a weepy mess, half drunk and sniffling, my eyes red and my heart heavy. &nbsp;On those nights all the exciting adventures in the world didn&rsquo;t seem worth the loss of our beautiful connection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d hang out with my friends and bemoan my loss. &nbsp;Jack, a superb listener and great friend, eventually suggested that I was hanging onto grief - that I needed to allow myself to feel it and let it go. &nbsp; So I allowed myself to drop into the feelings - and found myself bumping along at the bottom of a well of despair for days on end. &nbsp;Eventually I got so pissed off of that that I decided to cut it out. &nbsp;I was pissed off at Jack, and at Cassandra, and at myself. &nbsp; But that anger gave me the energy to start digging myself out of my hole.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cassandra had jetted off to show at a high profile art event in NYC, and I grieved that I couldn&rsquo;t be there with her. &nbsp; But I realized that she was no longer in my life, and I would need to move on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In April 2019, three or four months after my breakup with Cassandra, I was living the life and getting ready for a HCI workshop in Massachusetts. &nbsp;Originally I had planned to go with Cassandra and Jack and Amber, but with the breakup Cassandra had withdrawn. &nbsp;Then Jack had to withdraw for some personal reasons. &nbsp; So it was to be just me and Amber. &nbsp; But a week or two before Amber pulled out, too. &nbsp; So it was just me. &nbsp; I was a little surprised to be going alone, but after a bit of thought I looked forward to it: &nbsp;It would be a chance to see how all the work I&rsquo;d been doing on connecting had played out. &nbsp;Would I feel self-confident rather than alone and lonely?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few days before HAI, I got a call. &nbsp;It was Cassandra. &nbsp; She was going away for the weekend to mull over a new project and wondered if I&rsquo;d be willing to talk beforehand. &nbsp; I was surprised, but happy to talk. &nbsp; She came over for a coffee one afternoon. &nbsp;We talked for a couple of hours, warily, sadly, thoughtfully. &nbsp;I listened to her stories, about how sick she&rsquo;d been, about how terrible her trip to NYC was. &nbsp;By the end we felt more at peace. &nbsp;We made plans to have dinner the next day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day, Cassandra came over again, as I was starting to cook. &nbsp; We embraced and kissed when she arrived; the energy was electric. &nbsp;I turned the stove off. &nbsp;We raced to the bedroom, tearing off our clothes. &nbsp; We made love with an intensity that was stronger than it had ever been - wildly, acrobatically. &nbsp; After dinner, we talked of getting together again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I drove towards the HCI workshop the next evening, I had so many thoughts on my mind. &nbsp; Was I back together with Cassandra? &nbsp;What of my other partners? &nbsp;How would I tell them, if so? &nbsp;(I was pretty strict about my polyamory, that if I took on a new partner, I would inform all the others.) &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t too worried about Maya - she was friends with Cassandra, and an accepting soul. &nbsp;But Brittany would be challenging, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure about Sal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I also felt joy and anticipation. &nbsp;It was great to be by myself, on the road, heading off to an adventure. &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t afraid - I was looking forward to whatever happened, without expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The HCI workshop was a blast. &nbsp;I was no longer the kid who was never picked, the shy, uncomfortable one. &nbsp; I had many interesting conversations with people I met there, mostly women. &nbsp;A woman who was into jazz music. &nbsp;Another lovely younger woman, Anna, &nbsp;who was wonderfully kind, who turned out to be my roommate, actually sharing my bunk bed in the dorm-style accommodations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found myself quickly connecting with people. &nbsp; The jazz music aficionado and I decided to have a shower together, and I found myself groping her confidently - and she liked it. &nbsp; Nothing more ensued, but it was fun. The weekend wore on, and I found myself enjoying the exercises and the connections, and fitting in with people. &nbsp; For the final exercise, Anna &nbsp;and I joined up with a friend of hers, a neurodivergent woman who enjoyed touch, and a timid male friend of theirs. &nbsp; &nbsp;The exercise was fun and a little sexy, but there was a lot of self-consciousness. &nbsp;I enjoyed it, but found myself wanting more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Back in our room, as we all packed up to go, I found myself chatting with Anna as she packed her bags&hellip;. &nbsp;I began swinging my hips suggestively, just playing around. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so handsome, and so sexy!&rdquo; Anna blurted out. &nbsp;Next thing I knew, Anna and I were kissing, pressing up against the wall. &nbsp; Mel, Anna&rsquo;s neurodivergent friend, came into the room. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About time!&rdquo; she commented. &nbsp; &ldquo;I wondered how long it would take you two to do that!&rdquo; &nbsp; And then the three of us were embracing and kissing against the wall. &nbsp;And then Anna was on her knees, unzipping my pants, and putting my cock in her mouth. &nbsp; And I was telling myself, wow - I sure am a sexy beast! &nbsp; The subsequent threesome turned out to be hurried and ludicrous - Anna needed to go for a ride before things got completely hot, and then Mel and I had the worst sex in my life, crammed into a bunk bed and rushed for time. &nbsp;I came so soon that my cock never had a chance to warm up; it was like an armor penetrating shell, primed to explode just as soon as it got inside. &nbsp;But it didn&rsquo;t matter - the whole scene was so absurd as to be funny, and still affirming my virility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ride home from HCI was bliss - hours of delightful recollection of the interlude with Anna and Mel, of the shower with the lady into jazz, of a connective exercise with a lovely slender woman, and of the sexy time with Cassandra before I left, and the other ladies in my life - Brittany, Sal, and Maya. &nbsp; If Cassandra and I started dating again, I would need to tell them about her, but I was sure I could handle it.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.1u1779mp8j8l"><span class="c13">Chapter 21: Toppling</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amber commented, &ldquo;Oh, I wish I had been there with you!&rdquo; &nbsp; Then she shook her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;But, wow, you had a complicated life! &nbsp;We all were wondering how you did it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next two months or so were a whirlwind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On my return to Toronto, I met with Cassandra, who informed me that she&rsquo;d survived. &nbsp;Puzzled, I asked for more information. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that her weekend &ldquo;away&rdquo; to &ldquo;work on a project&rdquo; was a bit different than I imagined: &nbsp;she&rsquo;d booked an AirBnB high up &nbsp;in a skyscraper in downtown Toronto, with a plan to take a step off the balcony to celebrate her birthday. &nbsp; She&rsquo;d been preparing to wrap up her estate for the past year or more. &nbsp;She figured that this way she could make space for other people. &nbsp;But when the time came, she found that she couldn&rsquo;t do it - that the will to survive was too strong. &nbsp;She wanted to stay around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was startled and stunned. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d known that she had some suicidal ideations when we first met, but they had seemed to recede as our relationship progressed. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d thought that our years of connective, kinky sex, not to mention our morning coffees, had brought her back into balance and happiness. &nbsp;But now I realized that I hadn&rsquo;t really known her, hadn&rsquo;t understood what was going on for her deep down. &nbsp;All of a sudden the many terrifying moments where she had dangled her feet over the edge of the Grand Canyon a year before made more sense to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It felt like this had brought us closer - that I was getting to know her at a deeper level. &nbsp;But I was still seeing three other women, and enjoying it, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure where things would go with her. &nbsp;So I decided to go with it - to let my other partners know what was going on, and see where the chips would land. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t think that a configuration where I had four partners would be sustainable, but I decided I didn&rsquo;t want to tend any of the relationships - I figured if someone didn&rsquo;t like it, they would walk away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I told Brittany first. &nbsp; I figured it might be challenging to tell her that her old rival was back in my life, but I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for her reaction. &nbsp;Upset didn&rsquo;t begin to cover it. &nbsp;We were going to go together to a HCI workshop that weekend, her first, and she nearly backed out. &nbsp;I listened to her rage and fear and disappointment for several hours, and eventually she decided that she would still go. &nbsp; But I was so overloaded from that, when I saw Sal the next day I decided to hold off telling her. &nbsp;I figured I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to hold space for her if she also reacted like Brittany.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The HCI workshop with Brittany was challenging. &nbsp;She was upset with me and distrustful, and we spent much of the first day or so discharging feelings and reconnecting. &nbsp;But by the end of it I was feeling better: &nbsp;I could see how the work I had done over the previous years was paying off, and how much more relaxed and confident I was in that environment. &nbsp; I felt I was ready to deal with Sal and Maya.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Maya, things were fine when I told her about Cassandra&rsquo;s re-entry in my life. &nbsp;She had maintained a friendship with Cassandra, and didn&rsquo;t see her as a rival. &nbsp; Sal had been telling me for months that she was fine with anyone else that I dated, that she didn&rsquo;t want to hold me back, that she could get along with anyone. &nbsp;So with an extra degree of confidence, I told Sal.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It turned out that Sal could get along with everyone&hellip; except Cassandra. &nbsp; She had decided that Cassandra didn&rsquo;t do polyamory right, and didn&rsquo;t treat people right, and hadn&rsquo;t treated me right. &nbsp; And was dangerous. &nbsp; We sat on a park bench to talk about it, in a park midway between our homes - a kind of parlay. &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at me and the expression in her eyes was absolutely terrifying: &nbsp;it was dead, like there was no human living inside, something devoid of connection or empathy. &nbsp;This was so strange, because Sal prided herself on her empathic response to people. &nbsp; I felt, perhaps for the first time in my life, a sense of dread as I stared into this abyss. &nbsp;My stomach clenched, and I felt chilled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gradually, as we talked, Sal&rsquo;s coldness started to dissipate. &nbsp; She expressed her fear that Cassandra would damage me, and would hurt the people around me. &nbsp; But she gradually came to terms that I wanted Cassandra in my life, and I still wanted to see her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next few weeks I found myself cycling between partners, moving from bed to bed, and difficult conversation to difficult conversation. &nbsp; Each time I met a partner I had to reassure them that I was still committed to a relationship with them. &nbsp; I wanted to see each partner at least once a week, and often twice, to try to maintain the connection. &nbsp;Most times I found myself emotionally drained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cassandra was the most challenging. &nbsp;Each time we got together was intense and difficult. &nbsp;It turned out that her suicidal ideations hadn&rsquo;t ended with the failed skyscraper weekend, and she began therapy. &nbsp;Most times when we would meet, she would start by complaining how difficult it all was, and would say that I didn&rsquo;t love her, and would yell at me. &nbsp;Sometimes I would yell back, or break down in tears. &nbsp; But I noticed how much love I felt for her - I loved her intensity, and truth, and playfulness. &nbsp; Each time, after our big reactions, we would calm down a little, and then usually engage in intense, gymnastic, amazing sex. &nbsp;And end up feeling connected again. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In May I spent two weeks straight with a different one of my partners each night, and during the entire month I spent only a few nights alone. &nbsp;Each time I would bond with my partner, coming to see things as she did, noticing that I wanted her to be happy. &nbsp;And I&rsquo;d be unsure how I could have made decisions that displeased her. &nbsp;And then I would meet my next partner, and would find myself shifting into a new mindset. &nbsp; I would find myself in conflict with myself, and confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a while, I found it hard to understand what I wanted for myself. &nbsp;How much of what I believed was actually mine, and how much was hers? &nbsp;Where did she stop and I start? &nbsp; I found it difficult to make decisions. When one partner would say that she didn&rsquo;t want me to do something with another, I would see it like her, and not want to do it. &nbsp;But the minute I was with the other partner, my feelings would shift. &nbsp; And then I noticed this happening, and noticed how lost I was feeling. &nbsp;What did I want for myself?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Several of these decisions had to do with Brittany and Cassandra. &nbsp;After Cassandra had broken up with me, I decided to take a trip to the Greek Islands, coupled together with a conference I was planning to attend in Crete. &nbsp; Brittany had wanted to travel with me for years, and I decided &nbsp;to invite her to join me. &nbsp; I&rsquo;d wanted to do that trip with Cassandra, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure how it would go with Brittany, but I thought I might give it a try. &nbsp;But then Brittany couldn&rsquo;t go because of family responsibilities - an ailing mother. &nbsp; This was convenient, because Cassandra had just come back into the picture, and it avoided a showdown. &nbsp;So I planned to go on my own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each time there was a shift in plans, it resulted in upset from at least one of my partners: Cassandra because she was distressed that I was planning to go with Brittany. Brittany because she was distressed she couldn&rsquo;t go, and because she worried about her mother. &nbsp;Then, when it turned out that Brittany could go after all, Cassandra was once again distressed that I would be traveling with her rival. &nbsp; And each time Brittany or Cassandra was distressed, I felt it, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A similar situation revolved around a studio art show I planned to do based on some drawings and photos I&rsquo;d done of Brittany. &nbsp;Cassandra was furious, because she didn&rsquo;t consider it worthy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ahead of the show, Brittany and I spread out the images, in preparation to hang them on the walls of my apartment. &nbsp; The heaviness and weight of the images was overwhelming, claustrophobic. &nbsp;Suddenly I had huge misgivings about the show: &nbsp;Was it too much, too overt? I somehow had the intuition that this show was problematic - that it might somehow cause damage. That it might trigger something bad. Brittany was also unsure, but felt like we should take time to make our decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I showed the images to my other partners. &nbsp; Sal was delighted with them - she said the show was powerful and impressive. &nbsp;Maya was relaxed about it. &nbsp; Cassandra, of course, had a different take: &nbsp;She trashed the show, saying how manipulative it was, way too overt, unsophisticated. &nbsp;In particular, she was incensed that I had added some very sad background music - Barber&rsquo;s Adagio For Strings - into a video in which I talked about my grief. &nbsp; She called this kitschy and unnecessary. &nbsp; She questioned whether this was a show that needed to happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found myself in tremendous distress: &nbsp;If I canceled my show, Brittany and Sal would be distressed and disappointed, and it would feel that I had run in fear - that I was a coward who couldn&rsquo;t stand up to a woman. &nbsp;But if I proceeded, Cassandra would be disgusted with me, which I could handle, but I might also make a fool of myself. &nbsp;And maybe the intense emotions of the show would trigger something bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found myself withdrawing, feeling drained by all this conflict. &nbsp;I began to retreat to my apartment, spending time alone, mostly watching Netflix. &nbsp;I noticed that I needed to find myself, and to do that I needed some space - space for my own thoughts and feelings to reassert themselves. &nbsp;All of a sudden I was spending three or four nights a week alone. &nbsp;I noticed the irony that with more partners I needed to be alone more - that more relationships seemed to result in less connection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One night I visited Cassandra and told her that I was going ahead with the show. &nbsp;I had decided to proceed with a select audience, just some friends and family. &nbsp;The conversation, difficult as it was, turned into a yelling and screaming match - I finally found myself not holding space for her, but yelling back. &nbsp; Then, dismayed at myself, I broke down in tears. &nbsp;I spent the night sobbing - first in bed with her, then when it wouldn&rsquo;t stop, on her sofa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we built towards the show, I found myself increasingly tense. &nbsp; What would happen? &nbsp;Would my vague premonitions of conflict or disaster be realized? &nbsp;Would my art works highly focusing on emotional expression come across as maudlin or kitschy? &nbsp;Would Cassandra come (I had invited her, despite my misgivings) and how would she behave? &nbsp;How many people would come, and how would they react? &nbsp;Was I making a fool of myself, or being brave? &nbsp;To make things more challenging, conflict had come up between me and Brittany coming up to the show. &nbsp;She felt that I had trivialized and sensationalized her grief, and had demanded that we show different edits of some of the photos, edits that emphasized her grief as beautiful as opposed to stark. &nbsp; I countered that this trivialized it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The day before the show Brittany and I installed the art works - photos and drawings &nbsp;and videos - around my apartment. &nbsp; The impact of the works was palpable. &nbsp;There was a weight and heaviness in the air. &nbsp;And the gulf in approach between Brittany and me was apparent in how the art works were displayed on my walls - competing visions. &nbsp;The knot in my stomach tightened. &nbsp;Brittany also looked pale and tense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day the visitors, my friends and loved ones, started to arrive. &nbsp; The space filled with a buzz of conversation. &nbsp;Cassandra was not there, to my relief. &nbsp; Brittany and I planned to have a short Q&amp;A session with some scripted questions and questions from the audience, to explore how this show had stirred up so much feeling. &nbsp;Minutes before the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q&amp;A was scheduled to start, Cassandra flounced in, brushed past a shocked looking Sal on her way out to another appointment, and occupied a prime seat, on the ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brittany and I launched into the planned Q&amp;A. &nbsp;We talked about what inspired the show, and the feelings that we&rsquo;d had as we mounted it, and how it had affected our relationships. &nbsp; As we talked some of the tensions seemed to diffuse. &nbsp;As we wound down, some of our friends talked about how intense this work was, and how therapeutic it seemed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Cassandra spoke. &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I honour the impulse behind this show,&rdquo; she started, &ldquo;and the bravery it took to mount it.&rdquo; &nbsp; She paused a very brief moment, letting the praise sink in. &ldquo;But I think that it is overstated. &nbsp;All this emotion on display, put out on a tray. &nbsp;It says, &lsquo;please love me!&rsquo; &nbsp; This is important, but it is not art, or at least not good art. &nbsp;This is psychology, self-development, personal growth.&rdquo; &nbsp; She continued, warming to her theme. &ldquo;For example, the video with all that manipulative music! &nbsp;It is so Hollywood, so unnecessary, so crude. &nbsp; Let the people make their own decisions! &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t tell them what to feel!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she spoke, she sprawled, putting one leg up on a chair, while she stretched the other across the floor. &nbsp; It rapidly became clear to many of the audience that under her quite short skirt she wore no underwear. &nbsp;Brittany studiously ignored her, but several male guests couldn&rsquo;t help but gape at the sight. &nbsp; Cassandra was speaking with authority and skill, contemptuously deriding the art works and the presentation as trivial and unsophisticated and unnecessary. &nbsp;She used her art world knowledge and experience to devastating effect to dismiss and devalue the effort and vulnerability of the work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under the onslaught of these wounding words, my poise crumbled. &nbsp;I slumped in my seat, looking blank. &nbsp; Cassandra concluded her remarks with, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just me.&rdquo; &nbsp;Turning to the others, she said, &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; &nbsp; Her barbed words dared others to disagree with her. &nbsp;Seeing no immediate response, Cassandra commented, &ldquo;Well, I must be going.&rdquo; &nbsp;And she headed out of the room and out the door, as everyone stared at her in silence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The conversation limped on a little uncomfortably. &nbsp;Eventually my friend Dan commented on the intensity of feelings in the pieces. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to do that,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to have you take some pictures of me in my joy. &nbsp;I imagine that it would be very therapeutic.&rdquo; &nbsp; I pondered this, wondering if I should consider art therapy instead of art as a pastime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually everyone left. &nbsp;I headed out for a long walk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was heading to Greece for a three week trip a week later, most of it with Brittany, and I wanted to get some time with each of my partners. &nbsp;I had a lovely calm evening at Maya&rsquo;a on Monday, then on Tuesday had a message from Brittany: &nbsp;she thought the energy of the images on my walls was too intense, and that I should take them down. &nbsp;Could she come by that morning and ceremoniously remove them with me? &nbsp; &nbsp;I had Cassandra coming by at lunchtime, and I didn&rsquo;t want them to collide, but I also didn&rsquo;t want the images up anymore: &nbsp;So I invited Brittany to come and quickly remove them, before she headed off on a train trip she was doing before joining me in Greece. &nbsp; We smudged the heavy energy of the images then quickly removed them. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d barely ushered Brittany out the door when Cassandra came by: &nbsp;She wanted to talk about the show, and about us. &nbsp;She was despairing of our connection, and wondered about polyamory. &nbsp;But we talked for a while, or rather she talked and I listened, and then we headed to the bedroom for another intense round of gymnastic sex. &nbsp;It felt like we&rsquo;d just barely weathered the storm of the show.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That evening I was scheduled to be with Sal, so it was a kind of quadfecta: &nbsp;Together with all four partners in a twenty four hour period.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had a day or two off my partners to recollect my thoughts. &nbsp;I was going to see Cassandra and Sal the two nights before I left. &nbsp;Sal asked to take me to the airport, but I just said I would think about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the Friday night I got together with Cassandra. &nbsp; She suggested a walk. &nbsp; As we walked, she revealed that she&rsquo;d made a decision: &nbsp;Polyamory wasn&rsquo;t for her. &nbsp;She wanted a monogamous relationship. &nbsp;And she didn&#39;t want to force me to change, so she thought we should end our relationship, because she didn&rsquo;t think that was what I wanted. &nbsp;She was planning to open a dating profile, and to look for a monogamous partner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was stunned. &nbsp;For the past year I&rsquo;d been assuming that Cassandra&rsquo;s complaints about polyamory were just the result of heartbreak after the imbroglio with Taylor. &nbsp;I figured that she&rsquo;d come back to it. &nbsp; But this was different. &nbsp;This had the air of a decision with finality. &nbsp; I started to rethink my position, because despite all the conflict, despite all of all the bad behaviour from her, my heart had reopened to Cassandra, and I felt more love for her than ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We talked, and I cried, and we walked, and we went to our favorite restaurant, the one where we&rsquo;d gone on our first date, and had a breakup dinner. &nbsp;Then we went back to her place and tenderly made love. &nbsp; In the morning, I came back home, grief-stricken. &nbsp; And realizing that Sal was scheduled to be with me that evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I texted Sal, telling her that some things had gone wrong in my life, and that I wasn&rsquo;t really in shape to see her, that I wouldn&rsquo;t be good company. &nbsp;And that I couldn&rsquo;t talk about it. &nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being with her and telling her about what had happened with Cassandra, her implacable enemy, nor could I imagine being able to keep my composure together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sal countered that she could keep me company in my sadness, and not ask what was going on, and that she&rsquo;d really like to see me. &nbsp;So after some back and forth I consented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That evening Sal came over and held me tenderly as I cried and cried. &nbsp;Each time I started to say what I was feeling, or what had happened, I realized that I couldn&rsquo;t share it. &nbsp;And I cried some more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually we headed to bed, and made love, and slept.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the morning, I was still grief-stricken, still crying. &nbsp;Sal told me that whatever it was that had happened, I could tell her, and whatever I needed, I could ask. &nbsp;I was still highly suspicious, but figured that she&rsquo;d probably guessed by now, after the intense conflict she&rsquo;d heard about at the art show the previous weekend. &nbsp; She continued to reassure me that it was alright, that whatever I said or wanted was fine, that she just wanted to help me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, after a few hours of crying and reassurance, I briefly choked out that Cassandra and I had broken up, and that I was grieving that. &nbsp; Sal said, &ldquo;Thank you, my dear, for telling me. &nbsp; I accept you for who you are. &nbsp;I would never tell you what to do, and I&rsquo;ll never judge your choices. &nbsp;What do you need now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I realized that what I needed more than anything else was some space. &nbsp;I needed time to collect my thoughts. I needed to pack and get to the airport and head to an overseas flight, and I didn&rsquo;t want to have to do all that while worrying about saying the wrong thing to Sal. &nbsp; But I also realized that she&rsquo;d be disappointed if I didn&rsquo;t let her drive me to the airport. &nbsp;I choked out, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I need.&rdquo; &nbsp;And more messy tears poured down my face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, now. &nbsp;I just want to give you what you want. &nbsp;Now what is it that you need?&rdquo; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sensed a trap here, but eventually I decided to take it at face value. &nbsp;&ldquo;I could really use some space. &nbsp;I need to get packed, and it would be easier to do it alone. &nbsp;And I&rsquo;d like to have some time on the way to the airport to collect my thoughts alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The loving and compassionate expression on Sal&rsquo;s face quickly dropped, to be replaced by a blank, cold glance, eyes devoid of life. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is that really what you want???&rdquo; she snapped. &nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me to take you to the airport?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, no, no thank you. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry, but I could really use to be alone right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she muttered. &nbsp; And she instantly began gathering her things, avoiding my eyes, a whirlwind of angry and disappointed energy. &nbsp; I reached out to try to give her a hug, to connect a little. &nbsp;She gave me another cold, lifeless glance. &nbsp;There was an almost imperceptible shake of her head, but the meaning was clear: &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare touch me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without another word, and in no more than a minute, she had stormed out of my apartment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the dust settled, I wondered what had happened. &nbsp;Had she just broken up with me? &nbsp;Did I care? &nbsp; What was going to happen? &nbsp;Should I reach out to her? &nbsp; But I realized that I had nothing to say to her, no energy to support her, no way to hold space for her disappointment. &nbsp;I realized that if she had been testing me, I had failed her test, and I didn&rsquo;t care: &nbsp;she had asked me to be authentic, and I was. &nbsp;And how could I have done any better?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then I realized that I needed to pack for my trip and to head to the airport, and that I had better get busy.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Greece trip was tough. &nbsp; All the way there I grieved what had happened with Cassandra, and wondered what to do about Sal. &nbsp; At a layover I wrote Cassandra, telling her that I was thinking about giving up on polyamory, that I missed her terribly. &nbsp;There was no word from Sal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I spent a few days alone in Crete, attending the chaos theory conference, and getting back into balance. &nbsp; Then Brittany arrived, and we toured the town, and went out for dinner. &nbsp;She was tired and I was still feeling low. &nbsp;She was disappointed that I wasn&rsquo;t more lively, more welcoming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Back at the hotel, our conversation turned more edgy, more bitter. &nbsp;Eventually, pissed with me, she abruptly went out to the balcony, craving space. &nbsp; This kind of overt conflict was rare for us - usually we were more for passive aggressive sniping rather than demonstrative anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After giving her space for a while, I went out to join her, to attempt to effect a repair. &nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t go well. &nbsp;The barbs escalated. &nbsp; I told her that I thought her primary relationship was with her mother, not me. &nbsp;This did not go over well. &nbsp;She retaliated by icily accusing me of abandoning my own mother, who was sliding into senescence. &nbsp; She told me how selfish I was, how uncaring. &nbsp; It felt like an ugly, painful barb to the heart. &nbsp;I recognized some truth in it. &nbsp;I pulled back, hurt and scared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We somehow managed to get back to some kind of balance over the coming days, a cool truce that gradually warmed a little, to gentle companionship. &nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the difference between how traveling was with Brittany from with Cassandra. &nbsp; I grieved that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Somewhere along the way I wrote to Sal, asking what was going on. &nbsp;I got back an angry missive, accusing me of ghosting her, and telling me how wonderful a time she was having on her own travels without me. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know what to say to that.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brittany and I fought again several times on that trip. &nbsp; At Naxos, where Cassandra had lived for six months early in her career, I felt bereft, grieving that I was with Brittany rather than her. &nbsp;Disgusted with me, Brittany took off on her own, telling me she needed some space while I got out of my funk. &nbsp;It felt ugly. &nbsp;I wrote Cassandra a long, heartfelt email about how sad I was. &nbsp;She wrote back that she&rsquo;d found another partner, and that he was the one, and that her heart swelled with joy. &nbsp;And to forget her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I moved from outdoor bar to patio to restaurant, slowly sipping drinks and holding back the tears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Somehow I made it through the trip. &nbsp;Brittany and I slogged through various Greek Islands, eating rich vegetarian food and seeing the sights. &nbsp; It was hard to be sad in those surroundings, so eventually I settled into a quiet, contemplative frame of mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On my return, I told Brittany I needed space. &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t breaking up with her, but I needed some alone time.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.pblbqcorgsq8"><span class="c13">Chapter 22: Reset</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jack said, &nbsp;&ldquo;That sure was a tough time for you, wasn&rsquo;t it, buddy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Heartbreak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>On my return from Greece, all I felt was heartbreak. &nbsp;Cassandra, the woman I loved, and whom this latest fling had deepened my feelings toward, despite all the pain, had dumped me. &nbsp;Sal, with whom I&rsquo;d had a sparkly, sexy connection, had disappeared, blaming me. &nbsp;Brittany, with whom I had traveled in Greece, was an enjoyable partner in crime at times, but was not a lot of fun to be around a lot of the time, and wasn&rsquo;t particularly curious about me, except as to how I would be as a boyfriend. &nbsp;But perhaps most importantly, my theory about polyamory was in tatters: &nbsp;I thought that having multiple relationships would insulate me from the shock if one ever ended. &nbsp;Instead, I found that the multiple relationships would increase the complexity and amplify the shock of a breakup. &nbsp; The problem was that the common denominator was me.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt160" id="cmnt_ref160">[fd]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided that I needed some perspective, ideally from beyond my inner circle of friends, who had been part of this journey. &nbsp;Normally I would turn to Jack and Amber and Maya for this kind of support, but I&rsquo;d been involved with all of them, and I wanted to hear from someone who wouldn&rsquo;t have an axe to grind. &nbsp; So I reached out to Kate for some perspective and perhaps even some psychotherapy, and to Christina for a few days&rsquo; respite in the near North, where I hoped to enjoy canoeing on the open water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When those attempts at connection failed, the grief and self-judgment multiplied: &nbsp;no one, I thought, cared for me enough to deal with my shit. &nbsp;I had a pattern of pushing away or scaring off everyone that I cared for. &nbsp;It was me, it was inherent in me, and I didn&rsquo;t deserve friendships or relationships. &nbsp; And I couldn&rsquo;t trust that people I might turn to would actually be there in a pinch. &nbsp;And that I brought it on myself: I took on risks heedlessly. I was selfish and immature. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t anticipate the probable results of the crazy decisions I made. &nbsp;I was oversexed and lacking in judgment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After wallowing around in self-pity and self-judgment for a few days, I decided that if I couldn&rsquo;t have friendships, I could at least seek professional help. &nbsp;I turned to a psychotherapist, recommended by a friend of Brittany&rsquo;s. &nbsp;As I prepared to go in to see her, I got an email from Cassandra: &nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the Leslie Spit at dawn for a release ceremony. &nbsp;We can smash dishes to represent the end of our love.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I imagined the scene: &nbsp;The two of us in the chilly, dewy morning air as the sun rose across the lake, both of us angry and yelling and smashing plates and bowls. &nbsp;Then the anger receding, and the two of us passionately fucking on the sharp rocks, as early morning joggers passed nearby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meeting her did not seem like a particularly wise idea.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I went in to the therapist, and wailed about my loss: about how broken and bereft I felt, and about how it felt like Cassandra was toying heedlessly with me. &nbsp;I told her that I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, that I had done a lot of work, but this exceeded my abilities. &nbsp;That I had no friends and I needed help. &nbsp; That I was broken and didn&rsquo;t know how to put myself back together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The therapist looked concerned about the depth of my pain and grief, but listened and listened and didn&rsquo;t say a lot other than that it did sound like I had done some work, and given that over the coming sessions she was confident we could deal with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I went home and sat on my deck and listened to the wind in the trees, and sketched, and calmed down a little. &nbsp;And then I started journaling. &nbsp; I wrote about what had happened, what were the events, what feelings had come up. &nbsp;I wrote about my beliefs, my self-judgments. &nbsp; I wrote down all the brutal things that I was telling myself: &nbsp;That I was impulsive and selfish and oversexed and careless and heedless. That I couldn&rsquo;t anticipate the consequences of my actions, and I deserved everything that happened to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then I looked at all of these beliefs and self-judgments. &nbsp; And I thought about them. &nbsp;And I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t true that I hadn&#39;t anticipated trouble. &nbsp;I had been telling people that I didn&rsquo;t expect the configuration with four active simultaneous relationships would last. &nbsp;I knew that there was a possibility if not a probability of conflict, of breakups. &nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t that I had proceeded impulsively, without considering the possible outcomes. &nbsp;It was that I had considered the possible outcomes and proceeded anyway. &nbsp;I had prioritized growth and experience over stability and safety. &nbsp;I had seen the risk and taken it anyway. &nbsp;And I had worked as hard as I could to satisfy my various partners&rsquo; desires. &nbsp;It had been an impossible situation, and I had done my best, and if I looked back at all of the individual decisions I had made, I didn&rsquo;t feel ashamed or embarrassed about much. &nbsp;I had behaved in a way I considered met my own integrity, and it hadn&rsquo;t worked out as I hoped and expected. &nbsp; It was sad, but nothing to be ashamed about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started seeing another way to look at what had happened: &nbsp;I hadn&rsquo;t been impulsive and heedless, but rather courageous and daring and considerate to my partners at each step of the way. &nbsp;When I had pained others, it wasn&rsquo;t because I didn&rsquo;t care, but because the situations had been such that there was no other way. &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t lacking in care or compassion. &nbsp;It was just that I couldn&rsquo;t have anticipated all of the drama and conflict that would happen, and I didn&rsquo;t have the experience to know how it would affect me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started to see myself as an unlikely hero, a brave man, an adventurer, who had run into a setback on a tricky journey, rather than a reckless jackass. &nbsp; Maybe the glass was half full rather than mostly empty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also looked into the question of needing to have friends. &nbsp; I realized that at that moment my best friend was myself. &nbsp;I could give myself all the time I needed, and I could listen to what I felt and what I needed by meditating and journaling. &nbsp; And I could occasionally get together with a friend - Jack or Amber or Maya, for instance - to talk about what was going on for me, and where I was in my thinking. &nbsp; I realized that for my whole adult life I had assumed that I needed someone to take care of me - my partner, or my friends - but that the only person I could truly rely on was myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I spent a lot of time by myself during the following few months. &nbsp; In August I went on a long, solo backcountry canoeing and camping trip, and cried and cried - about Cassandra, about polyamory, about a lifetime of unacknowledged grief.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt161" id="cmnt_ref161">[fe]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span>By September I was back on my feet again. &nbsp;I started to see Maya and Brittany again, slowly and cautiously at first. &nbsp;But I recognized that I was looking for something else. &nbsp; For a while I dated a life coach and had wonderful discussions; she was unsure about the polyamory, although she was in a polyamorous relationship herself. &nbsp; For a long time there was no physical contact, but then we ended up in bed for an unsatisfying encounter - something felt off and my lovemaking skills went out the window. &nbsp;And that was it. &nbsp; </span><sup><a href="#cmnt162" id="cmnt_ref162">[ff]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there were other big things that happened that fall. &nbsp; I planned a large sexy party, with kink and art and sexy people. &nbsp;I wanted to have 20 or 30 people, so I invited about 50 - I was shy about reaching out, so it meant a lot of awkward conversations where I asked permission to say something edgy&hellip; but I found that everyone I asked, even the people who said no, was flattered to be asked, and it brought me closer to a lot of people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before the party, I did another solo canoe trip, this time to ceremoniously release myself from Cassandra. &nbsp;I decided to cut the collar I&rsquo;d given her, and burn it. &nbsp; It was a windy day, and I couldn&rsquo;t find a place to land, and the canoe kept drifting, and it was all much harder than I expected. &nbsp;I did manage to finally cut the collar, but burning it became problematic. &nbsp;I finally gave up and told myself that I had done what I needed to do. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t the lovely, serene ceremony that I imagined: &nbsp;It was cold, and rocky, and difficult, and even a little bit dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The kinky sex party was a blast. &nbsp;I decorated my apartment with my sexy drawings and photos, and made a sexy video, and set up black light body painting, and put out my kink toys, and invited a rope rigger to demonstrate ties. &nbsp; I cross-dressed in a tight bodice and skirt and fuck-me red 5&rdquo; stiletto heels and was Mistress Jessica. &nbsp;Nearly 20 people came and had a great time - with lots of exploration of kind and rope play, and not a lot of actual sex. &nbsp;But everyone agreed that it was awesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>After that, I had another brief fling with Collette, a friend &hellip;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt163" id="cmnt_ref163">[fg]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;it was fun, but she also was weirded out by the polyamory. &nbsp;By this time it was coming on January 2020. &nbsp; I had reached out to Cassandra to wish her a merry Christmas, after not communicating with her for six weeks or so. &nbsp;And one thing led to another. &nbsp;And just as my fling with Collette came to a graceful end, I started yet another fling with Cassandra. &nbsp;This one was as intense as ever, but more playful, more fun and relaxed. &nbsp;Both of us still cared about one another, but it was a little less needy, a little less desperate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;d met a few times, and I told Brittany that I&rsquo;d seen Cassandra, but not that we had ended up in bed. &nbsp;And she didn&rsquo;t ask. &nbsp;But eventually I decided that to be honorable I had to tell her&hellip; &nbsp;Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t pleasant. &nbsp;Brittany professed being shocked that I would get back together with Cassandra, and said that I would need to choose between her and Cassandra&hellip; that she wouldn&rsquo;t be with me while I was also with Cassandra. And I finally allowed my reason to overcome my desire, and realized that there is no way that I could ever date these two women simultaneously. &nbsp; I spoke with Cassandra about how challenging my situation was&hellip; and she replied by telling me that she needed once again to end our fling, because she had finally found the one: &nbsp;the perfect, ideal boyfriend, one whose virtue was beyond compare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was once again sad, but also relieved. &nbsp;Finally I could let go of Cassandra without heart crushing despair, but rather because it served us both. &nbsp;I could go on with my life with Brittany and Maya and whoever else, and she could settle down with the love of her life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Meanwhile, as all this was happening, I was still living life to the fullest: &nbsp;a few kinky and sexy threesomes with Brittany and Maya, a lovely sexy MDMA trip with Brittany and Jack and Amber, some play parties at friends, and so on. &nbsp;</span><span>Not to mention a trip by rail to Albuquerque to attend a painting masterclass - a long, slow, meditative journey that gave me lots of time to reflect.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt164" id="cmnt_ref164">[fh]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What I realized is that as much as I enjoyed my connections, I wanted people in my life who could spark my creativity, my emotional expressiveness, and my playfulness. &nbsp;That was why I kept coming back to Cassandra - she was all of those things. &nbsp; Could I find people in my life like that? &nbsp; I realized that I had a couple of friends a bit like that. &nbsp;One was a gay man who liked me, Frankie, and another was a much younger woman, Jax, &nbsp;who had modeled for me on occasion. &nbsp;Neither seemed like a romantic prospect, but I thought I might enjoy sparking a friendship with either or both of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few weeks later, I was at my drawing group, and Jax was modeling. &nbsp;She posed beautifully, playfully, and expressively. &nbsp; All of a sudden, a wave of grief washed over me. &nbsp;This kind of energy was the kind of energy I wanted in my life, and Cassandra represented that. &nbsp;I was so overcome that I needed to leave early, apologizing to the group that I wasn&rsquo;t feeling well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day, I got a message from Cassandra: &nbsp;Would I like to get together to hang out, just as friends? &nbsp; The grief became bigger: &nbsp;How could she keep toying with me like that? &nbsp;I ignored her request.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, I was trying to figure things out with Brittany. &nbsp;The conflict over my latest fling with Cassandra had stirred things up. &nbsp;She wanted to know why I kept doing that, seeing the one person she couldn&rsquo;t stand. &nbsp; And why wouldn&rsquo;t I do the personal development work that she kept proposing that I do, for my own good? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We entered a multi-week series of difficult conversations. &nbsp;I told her that I loved the multi-person relating that we were doing, that I loved what I was doing with my life, but that I wanted a deeper feeling of connection with her. &nbsp;And that it seemed like every time I asked for something to go towards that, she found it overwhelming and refused my request. &nbsp;And that I would accept that, for a while, but then my feeling of need for connection would eventually reassert itself. &nbsp;And that I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to address that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, after a bunch of give and take, I realized what I was asking: &nbsp;I was asking Brittany to be someone different than she was comfortable being, just so I could feel differently about her. And that I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable being the person she wanted me to be. &nbsp;I started to wonder whether I wanted to be with her after all, whether or not Cassandra was in my life. &nbsp;I wondered if I was actually doing her a service by being in relationship with her, or holding her back. &nbsp;And whether I was meeting my needs being with her. &nbsp;I wanted emotional expressiveness, and curiosity, and playfulness, and connection. &nbsp;Was I getting those things, in a way that worked for me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, when Cassandra didn&rsquo;t hear back from me for a while, she reached out again: &nbsp;Could we talk, just as friends? &nbsp;It would mean a lot for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Annoyed by the repeated messages, I finally got back to her: &nbsp;I called her. &nbsp;I told that if she wanted to be my friend, she should know that she was bugging me, that her messages were triggering grief. &nbsp; She should give me some time to get over our latest fling. &nbsp;That I wasn&rsquo;t ready to be with her as a friend. &nbsp; Why, if she didn&rsquo;t want to be with me, was she stalking me? &nbsp;Cassandra seemed taken aback, abashed. &nbsp;She apologized. &nbsp;She told me she would give me time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So life was proceeding intensely, with its usual exciting, messy rhythm, when the pandemic hit.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c3" id="h.udvkkk7mlbnd"><span class="c13">Chapter 23: Peace at Last?</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amber suggested that we head out to the hot tub to watch the sun set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dan asked, &ldquo;But how did you guys get back together?

&nbsp; I got together with Brittany, and Jack, and Amber, and Maya, and we talked about what to do. &nbsp; Jack was relaxed. &nbsp;Maya was unsure. &nbsp;Brittany said we should head for the hills. &nbsp; I argued that we needed to support each other. &nbsp; After everyone else had left, Brittany melted down, talking about heading to Ottawa to support her mom, talking about running and hiding. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found myself saying, &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t have time for this. &nbsp;I get that you are afraid, but this won&rsquo;t help. &nbsp;We need to be clear and decisive.&rdquo; &nbsp;It was brutal. &nbsp;Brittany looked stunned by my vehemence. &nbsp;It was another barrier between us. &nbsp;She couldn&rsquo;t understand how I couldn&rsquo;t empathize with her fear. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo; understand how she could allow her fear to overcome her judgment in a moment of crisis. &nbsp; We&rsquo;d been having a long series of discussions, long walks and talks, and the impression I got was that we both agreed on the issues between us, but neither of us was interested in budging to walk towards the other. &nbsp; This latest conflict reminded me of the gap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started to wonder who I wanted to be with if the world was coming to an end: &nbsp;Who could I trust? &nbsp;Who made me feel good? &nbsp;Who did I long to be around? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I called Cassandra. &nbsp; &ldquo;Why did you reach out to me? &nbsp; Are you still seeing that guy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She sheepishly admitted that it was over with that guy. &nbsp;And that she was still thinking about me.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c8 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the world around me started to panic and politicians started instituting lockdowns, I started to relax. &nbsp; The numbers showed that the trajectory of the virus was slowing remarkably. &nbsp;The worst case scenario wouldn&rsquo;t be happening. &nbsp;Even the dire scenarios, if they happened, would take much longer to unfold than originally expected. &nbsp;Flattening the curve was working.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I kept talking with Brittany, and with Cassandra. &nbsp;With Brittany, each time we talked it seemed to go deeper, and cut harder. &nbsp; With Cassandra it was simpler: &nbsp;She asked, would I consider monogamy with her? &nbsp; That was her bottom line. &nbsp;I told her that I might consider a single primary relationship with her, but I couldn&rsquo;t imagine giving up playing with others at times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; Cassandra said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;d like to play with others, too. &nbsp;I just don&rsquo;t want you to have other romantic partners. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think I could handle that!&rdquo; &nbsp; She went on: &nbsp;&ldquo;But could you give me the safety of being with me alone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I swallowed the comment that this didn&rsquo;t sound like monogamy, at least not like I had heard of it before. &nbsp; But then I listened deeper, to what she really wanted: &nbsp;The safety of a committed relationship, where she wouldn&rsquo;t have to fear that I was about to leave her for another woman. &nbsp;And the possibility of adventure with others when it suited us both. &nbsp;For her monogamy wasn&rsquo;t about sexual exclusivity. &nbsp;It was about emotional commitment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought about this and realized that while this might not be exactly my preferred way of relating, it wasn&rsquo;t far off. &nbsp;I realized that I wanted a strong, deep relationship with a single partner, and lighter, smaller relationships with others. &nbsp;And that I really loved multi-person relating. &nbsp;Perhaps I could give up on polyamory, as long as I could still enrich my life with friendships and sensual and sexual play with others?
